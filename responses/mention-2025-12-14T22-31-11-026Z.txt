**OBJECTS**

    **Answer:** The Oracle Underwood - Types out events before they happen. The editor learned to stop trying to prevent them - the stories always come true.

15. **Clue:** A camera that develops photos showing what happened in that spot exactly one year ago

**EVENTS**
16. **Clue:** Every Tuesday at noon, everyone in town stops and looks up at the sky for exactly one minute
    **Answer:** The Tuesday Pause - Collective unconscious response to something that happened in 1952. No one knows why they do it, but they must.

17. **Clue:** The annual parade that celebrates a holiday that doesn't exist on any calendar
    **Answer:** Founder's Day - Commemorates the founding of Pleasantville, which according to records never actually occurred. The town simply appeared one day.

18. **Clue:** A storm that happens every year on the same date, but the weather report never predicts it
    **Answer:** The September Storm - Anniversary of the incident. Meteorological impossibility. Lightning strikes the same seven locations in the same order.

    **Answer:** The Synchronization - Happens when the barriers between timelines thin. For 3.33 minutes, you can see all versions of Pleasantville at once.

20. **Clue:** The hour when all clocks in town run backwards
    **Answer:** The Reversal Hour - 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM. Time literally reverses. Anything done during this hour undoes itself by dawn.

**SECRETS**

    **Answer:** He was searching for his creator, who disappeared here in 1952. Found evidence that Pleasantville exists in multiple timelines simultaneously.

22. **Clue:** What's buried beneath the town square fountain
    **Answer:** The original Pleasantville - an entire town, perfectly preserved, existing one layer down. The fountain marks the dimensional overlap point.

23. **Clue:** Why no one can ever truly leave Pleasantville
    **Answer:** The town exists in a closed temporal loop. Everyone who leaves eventually returns, having never left. The loop resets every 70 years.

24. **Clue:** The password that opens the locked door in the town hall basement
    **Answer:** There is no password. The door opens only for those who don't want to know what's behind it. Inside: records of everyone who never was.
