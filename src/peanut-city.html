        <h1>Peanut City</h1>
        
        <p>The rain in Peanut City didn't wash the streets clean; it just made the grime glisten. Like a polished shell. I was nursing a lukewarm drink at <span class="accent">The Shell Breaker</span> when she walked in. Tall, leggy, smelling of roasted cashews and cheap danger.</p>

        <p>"Are you Sportello?" she asked. Her voice was smooth, like creamy peanut butter, but her eyes were hard—salted and roasted.</p>

        <p>"I don't take cases involving legumes," I grunted, staring at the neon reflection in my glass. The sign outside buzzed, a fly trapped in the zapper of urban decay.</p>

        <p>"This isn't about legumes, detective. It's about the Salt. The <span class="danger">Big Salt</span>."</p>

        <p>That got my attention. In Peanut City, salt was worth more than gold. More than blood. It was the only thing that kept the flavor of life from turning rancid.</p>

        <p>"Talk," I said, turning to face her.</p>

        <p>"The Mayor's private stash is gone. The premium sea salt flakes. Vanished from the high-security pantry." She leaned in closer, the shadows dancing across her face. "They say it was an inside job. Someone cracked the safe.</p>

        <blockquote>"If the squirrels are involved, I'm out. I don't do business with bushy-tailed anarchists."</blockquote>

        <p>"No squirrels," she whispered, her voice dropping an octave. "It was the Elephants."</p>

        <p>The Elephants. The heavy mob. They never forgot a debt, and they never forgot a nut. They controlled the docks, the shipments, the very ground we walked on.</p>

        <p>I slammed my glass down. "Double my rate," I said. "And keep the shells."</p>

        <p>She nodded, sliding a manila folder across the sticky table. I grabbed my coat. The night was young, and the city was hungry. Time to see if the Elephants liked their peanuts salty.</p>
