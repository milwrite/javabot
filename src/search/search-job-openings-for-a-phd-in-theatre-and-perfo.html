        <h1>Comprehensive Analysis of Job Opportunities for PhD Theatre and Performance Studies Professionals in Museums and Cultural Institutions, November-December 2025</h1>
<p>The job market for professionals holding PhD degrees in theatre and performance studies represents a specialized and evolving sector within the broader landscape of cultural institutions and academic employment[3][21]. This report examines available position listings from November through December 2025 targeting individuals with advanced degrees in theatre and performance studies, particularly those positions emphasizing archival work, exhibition development, and public programming within museum and cultural institutional settings. While the search reveals a complex employment landscape with limited positions specifically requiring a PhD in theatre and performance studies at cultural institutions during this period, the analysis identifies meaningful career pathways, demonstrates the types of roles available for advanced performance scholars, and contextualizes these opportunities within the broader museum and cultural sector employment trends.</p>
<h2>The Current Job Market for Theatre Performance PhDs in Cultural Institutions</h2>
<p>The employment landscape for individuals with doctoral training in theatre and performance studies presents a distinctive challenge that differs significantly from both general humanities PhD markets and specialized museum professional tracks[3][21]. Individuals with PhDs in theatre and performance studies possess unique combinations of scholarly expertise, practical performance knowledge, and pedagogical training that position them for roles beyond traditional academic positions[3][21]. However, the intersection of theatre-specific expertise with museum-based positions remains relatively limited compared to positions available in visual arts curation, archaeological management, or general arts administration[2][14].</p>
<p>The broader context of cultural institution employment in late 2025 reveals an active job market across museums, galleries, and heritage organizations nationwide[2][14][31]. The Association of Registrars and Collections Specialists, a primary professional organization tracking museum positions, reported numerous openings across registration, collections management, and curatorial tracks[2][14][31]. Simultaneously, universities continued recruiting theatre faculty members, though these positions typically target practitioners and scholars rather than emphasizing the exhibition and archival dimensions most relevant to this analysis[1][13]. The tension between these parallel tracks—academic theatre positions and museum cultural roles—creates a unique employment landscape where individuals with theatre PhDs may need to consider positions beyond traditional theatre faculty appointments.</p>
<h2>Archival and Collections Management Opportunities in Museums: November-December 2025</h2>
<p>The period from November through December 2025 witnessed significant recruitment activity in museum archival, registration, and collections management positions that, while not exclusively designed for theatre specialists, offer potential career trajectories for individuals with advanced degrees in performance studies[2][14][31]. The Collections Manager position for Archaeology at Indiana University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, posted November 3, 2025, illustrates the types of collections-focused roles becoming available[2]. This position, offering a salary range of $55,000 to $60,000 annually, required candidates to demonstrate thorough knowledge of archives and records management, experience organizing and managing large volumes of materials, and expertise in arranging and describing public and private records and collections[2]. While positioned within archaeology rather than performance studies, this role demonstrates the essential skills that theatre PhDs with archival interests could develop and apply[2].</p>
<p>Several registrar positions posted during late November and early December 2025 provide additional archival pathways. The Registrar—Exhibitions position at MoMA PS1, posted November 24, 2025, sought an experienced exhibitions registrar to join a team of three registrars in the planning, documentation, and logistics surrounding a robust program of loans, exhibitions, and installations[2][14][31]. This position, offering compensation between $70,000 and $75,000 annually, required significant experience and expertise in collection management and complex exhibition logistics[2]. The role involved monitoring fine art holdings, implementing policies and procedures to support exhibition programs, maintaining best museum practices, and supervising seasonal gallery installation staff[2][14]. Though focused on visual arts rather than performance documentation, the position exemplified how exhibition registrars work across institutional departments to coordinate curatorial, conservation, education, and administration functions—skills equally applicable to theatre and performance material[2][14].</p>
<p>The Director of Registration position at Baltimore Museum of Art, posted November 24, 2025, represented a senior-level opportunity demonstrating career advancement pathways within museum registration and collections management[2][14]. This role, compensated at $91,838 annually, required a seasoned museum professional with experience in medium-to-large sized art museums and deep expertise in both collection management and complex exhibition logistics[2]. The position oversaw a team of six professionals including five registrars and one art packer, managing all aspects of collections care, documentation, and stewardship[2][14]. Leadership responsibilities included fostering a culture of collaboration, accountability, and innovation while maintaining adherence to professional standards and best museum practices[2].</p>
<h2>Curatorial Fellowships and Professional Development Pathways</h2>
<p>Curatorial fellowship programs represent specialized professional development opportunities particularly relevant for PhD-holding professionals seeking to transition into museum-based careers[7][55]. The Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco's search for an Assistant or Associate Curator of Prints and Drawings, with applications reviewed on a rolling basis and priority given to applications received by December 7, 2025, exemplified the types of curatorial positions available to advanced scholars[7]. This position offered salary ranges of $77,000 to $82,000 for the Assistant Curator level and $87,000 to $92,000 for the Associate Curator level, depending on experience and credentials[7].</p>
<p>The Assistant Curator position required minimum qualifications including a Master's Degree in art history or related field (with PhD in art history preferred), two years of curatorial experience or similar such as curatorial fellowships, specialized knowledge in the history and techniques of graphic arts, and expertise on modern and contemporary works on paper, particularly American printmaking of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries[7]. Associate Curator positions required four years of curatorial experience and the same specialized knowledge base[7]. Duties encompassed research and cataloguing collections, ensuring accurate museum database records in the TMS (The Museum System) collection management platform, answering public and scholar inquiries, coordinating scholarly visits, presenting research and lectures, managing departmental projects, coordinating with other departments, building community relationships, and executing special exhibitions[7].</p>
<p>Particularly significant for performance studies professionals, the National Gallery of Art's Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Curatorial Fellowship in Prints and Drawings, with applications due December 1, 2025 for a winter 2026 start date, demonstrated how prestigious institutions support early-career curators[55]. This two-year fellowship, with possibility of renewal for a third year, offered full integration within the Division of Prints and Drawings with duties and status equivalent to assistant curators[55]. The fellowship provided curatorial training and supported scholarly research related to the Prints and Drawings collection, combining assigned projects with general curatorial work including research on collections and acquisitions, presentation and interpretation, special exhibition participation, and public lectures[55].</p>
<p>Eligibility requirements specified that applicants must hold a doctoral degree in art history (or equivalent outside the United States) officially conferred by employment start or received within five years prior to the start date[55]. Position requirements emphasized professional knowledge of American and/or European works on paper, research tools and methodology specific to works on paper, hands-on museum experience with works on paper, understanding of professional museum principles and practices, curatorial experience in museums including fellowships and internships, and preferred experience building relationships with museum colleagues and communities[55]. The fellowship position offered federal employee health benefits, federal employees group life insurance, annual and medical leave of 104 hours each per year, paid federal holidays, and public transportation subsidies, with benefits for non-U.S. citizens varying according to treaty requirements[55].</p>
<h2>Graduate Training Programs Preparing Performance Studies PhDs for Museum Careers</h2>
<p>Understanding current graduate education offerings provides context for how emerging professionals are being prepared for museum and cultural institution roles[3][9][21]. The University of Maryland's PhD program in Theatre and Performance Studies explicitly trains emerging scholar-artists in theatre, dance, and performance studies to advance not only in traditional theatre and performance careers but in "a plethora of adjacent art fields and roles as curators, administrators, policy makers, grant writers, program officers, etc."[3][21]. This programmatic orientation directly acknowledges the broader career pathways available for advanced performance scholars, moving beyond exclusive focus on academic employment.</p>
<p>The program's curriculum emphasizes interdisciplinary education that empowers students to work within and beyond the School of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies to tailor degree programs matching professional aspirations and trajectories inside or outside academia[3][21]. Students enjoy camaraderie with MFA students in Design and Dance, access to leading R1 graduate program faculty, and opportunities to tailor degrees with certificates in areas including Arts Entrepreneurship, Digital Studies, Women Gender and Sexuality Studies, Critical Theory, and Museum Scholarship and Material Culture[3][21]. The explicit inclusion of museum scholarship and material culture as certificate options indicates programmatic recognition of museum-directed career paths for performance studies PhDs[3][21].</p>
<p>Faculty leadership demonstrates commitment to nurturing scholar-artists equipped to leverage performing arts practice, historicism, and critique in service of human good while entering the world equipped for roles as publishing researchers, pedagogues, practitioners, curators, administrators, policy makers, grant writers, and program officers[3][21]. The program particularly emphasizes civic and cultural engagement, recognizing that theatre and performance function as public-interfacing practices with potential to function as agents of social transformation[3][21]. This pedagogical framework positions graduates to conceptualize and execute archival work, exhibition development, and public programming within museums and cultural institutions as extensions of scholarly and artistic practice rather than alternative career paths[3][21].</p>
<h2>Exhibition Development and Curatorial Practices in Contemporary Museums</h2>
<p>Exhibition development roles within museums represent significant opportunities for performance studies professionals, particularly those with interests in archival documentation and public interpretation[7][20][32]. The Associate Curator position at Albany Institute of History & Art, as detailed in Greater Hudson Heritage Network job listings, exemplified the exhibition-focused curatorial roles available during this period[20]. This position, compensated at $42,500 to $52,500 annually, required an advanced degree in art history, decorative arts, museum studies, or related field, with five to ten years of museum experience in curatorial work, exhibition development, interpretation, community engagement, or related areas[20].</p>
<p>Core competencies emphasized included strong knowledge of New York State art and history relevant to the museum's collection, commitment to ongoing professional development in American art and decorative arts, familiarity with American Alliance of Museums standards and best practices, exceptional writing skills for both scholarly and general audiences, demonstrated project-management experience, excellent communication and interpersonal skills enabling collaboration across departments and with diverse stakeholders, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively[20]. Exhibition-specific responsibilities encompassed conducting original research, selecting objects, writing exhibition labels and interpretive materials, proposing and developing temporary exhibitions, serving as in-house curator for traveling exhibitions, overseeing installation and deinstallation of exhibitions in collaboration with exhibition preparators, and working collaboratively with education and marketing departments to develop interpretive strategies and audience engagement opportunities[20].</p>
<p>The position's emphasis on exhibition labels, interpretive materials, and collaborative development of interpretive strategies directly parallels skills that performance studies PhDs develop through dramaturgy coursework, performance criticism, and pedagogical training[20]. The requirement for exceptional writing skills for both scholarly and general audiences aligns particularly well with theatre scholars' training in addressing multiple audiences through academic articles, critical essays, and public-facing scholarship[20].</p>
<h2>Public Programming and Community Engagement Roles in Cultural Institutions</h2>
<p>Public programming positions within museums and cultural institutions represent another significant career track for individuals with performance studies doctoral training[60]. The National Museum of American History's internship program and broader curatorial roles demonstrate how cultural institutions increasingly emphasize public programming and community engagement alongside traditional collections management[60]. Fall 2025 internship offerings at NMAH included positions specifically in public programming, community outreach, and museum education, with the Program in Latino History and Culture Internship working with the Director of Audience Development on museum programming and community engagement through diverse activities including research, communication, and writing[60].</p>
<p>While internship positions typically serve recent graduates rather than PhD-holders seeking full-time employment, they indicate institutional recognition that public programming requires specialized expertise in audience development, community engagement, and interpretive communication[60]. Chicago History Museum's curatorial staff provides instructive examples of how museum professionals with research and curation expertise apply their knowledge through public engagement[15]. The museum's virtual presentations program, led by curatorial staff including a Chief Historian serving as director of the Studs Terkel Center for Oral History, demonstrates how curators develop compelling interpretive content for diverse public audiences[15]. The museum's emphasis on topics including "Accelerate Action: Women in Chicago History," "Citizen Soldier: African Americans in Times of War," "Crime of the Century," and "Designing for Change: Chicago Protest Art of the 1960s-70s" illustrates how archival research and curatorial expertise translate into public programming[15].</p>
<h2>Scholarly Resources and Professional Networks for Performance Arts Archivists</h2>
<p>While specific current position listings remain limited, substantial professional infrastructure supports archivists and curators specializing in performing arts[44]. The American Theatre Archive Project, created in 2009 as an initiative of the American Society for Theatre Research, advocates for preservation of American theatrical legacy and provides resources to assist living theatre companies in managing current and archival records[44]. The project includes the Archiving Theatre Manual and access to consulting archivists, offering crucial support for professionals managing theatrical collections[44].</p>
<p>Dance/USA's Archiving and Preservation department specifically promotes the ability of diverse dance communities to safeguard and share legacies while promoting education and awareness of dance archiving practices and dance history and scholarship[44]. The Artists' Legacy Toolkit, freely available online, provides guidelines, tools, and templates helping independent artists and dance companies organize, preserve, and plan for legacy records[44]. The Theatre Library Association, dedicated to supporting librarians and archivists affiliated with theatre, dance, performance studies, popular entertainment, motion picture and broadcasting collections, provides a community of practice and career listings for professionals in this specialized field[44].</p>
<p>These professional organizations and resources indicate that while specific full-time positions combining PhD-level theatre expertise with museum archival work may appear limited in any given month, sustained professional infrastructure supports career development in this field[44]. Professional networking, consulting relationships, and fellowship programs often precede or lead to permanent institutional positions[44].</p>
<h2>Academic Theatre Faculty Positions as Alternative Trajectories</h2>
<p>While this report focuses primarily on museum-based positions, it merits noting that academic theatre faculty positions—which often involve archival research, exhibition development, and public programming through academic theatre productions—represent significant career pathways for theatre and performance studies PhDs[1][13]. The University of South Carolina Department of Theatre and Dance sought an instructor for a professional-track position with start date September 1, 2026, involving nine-month appointment with workload equivalent to teaching four courses per semester divided between traditional teaching and technical direction for dance productions[1]. The position required demonstrated excellence in teaching and collaboration but did not specifically list PhD requirements[1].</p>
<p>Binghamton University sought a full-time tenure-track Assistant Professor of Acting and Directing beginning Fall 2026, requiring significant experience teaching college-level acting and professional background in acting and/or directing, with desired expertise in Black, Indigenous, Latinx, AAPI, or MENA theatre[1][13]. The Hartt School at University of Hartford sought a full-time tenure-track Assistant Professor of Musical Theatre beginning August 2026, requiring demonstrated excellence teaching acting to undergraduate Musical Theatre students, collaborative spirit, and evidence of successful teaching and mentorship experience at universities or colleges for three or more years, curriculum development experience, and experience developing new works in theatre[1][13].</p>
<p>These academic positions, while not museum-based, involve archival research through scholarship, exhibition and public engagement through theatrical production seasons, and community programming through student training and recruitment[1][13]. Many theatre faculty positions include responsibilities for directing university theatre productions, creating platforms for student performance, and engaging communities through theatrical presentations[1][13].</p>
<h2>Salary Ranges and Professional Compensation in Museums and Cultural Institutions</h2>
<p>Understanding compensation structures provides essential context for career planning among PhD-holding professionals[2][7][14][20][31]. Registration and collections management positions in museums typically ranged from approximately $26 to $29 per hour for entry-level assistant registrar positions to $91,838 annually for senior director-level roles overseeing registration teams[2][14][31]. The Assistant Registrar position at Clark Art Institute, posted October 20, 2025, offered $26.00 to $28.90 per hour, providing approximately $54,080 to $60,128 annually for full-time positions[31]. The Associate Registrar position at Santa Barbara Museum of Art, posted December 12, 2025, similarly offered $29.87 per hour, approximately $62,128 annually[31][14].</p>
<p>Curatorial positions offered higher compensation reflecting advanced expertise and research responsibilities. Assistant and Associate Curator positions at Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco ranged from $77,000 to $92,000 annually depending on rank and experience[7]. The Registrar position at the Art Students League of New York offered $64,000 to $68,000[31]. The Senior Registrar position at Institute of Contemporary Art Boston offered $95,000[31]. Significantly, the Director of Registration position at Baltimore Museum of Art offered $91,838, demonstrating that senior-level positions in museum registration and collections management can provide compensation comparable to academic assistant professor positions[2][14].</p>
<p>Collections management specialized positions offered varied compensation reflecting institutional size and specialization. The Collections Manager for Archaeology at Indiana University Museum offered $55,000 to $60,000[2]. Collections management positions across institutions generally demonstrated that PhD-level expertise commands professional compensation, though entry-level archival and registrar positions may offer less than academic entry-level salaries[2][14][31].</p>
<h2>Interdisciplinary Opportunities: Conservation and Collections Analysis Programs</h2>
<p>For PhD-holding performance studies professionals interested in material culture analysis and conservation, specialized graduate programs offer additional career pathways[12]. The UCLA/Getty Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage, established in 2003 and offering both Master's and PhD degrees, trains students in theory and practice of conserving archaeological and Indigenous materials with emphasis on conservation research and material culture[12]. The PhD program focuses on conservation of material culture, educating students not only in conservation principles, science, and practice but in leadership and problem-solving addressing complex issues including climate change, illicit trade, and community engagement[12].</p>
<p>Faculty maintain interdepartmental affiliations in Art History, Information Studies, and Materials Science and Engineering, making the program unique in the United States by embedding faculty across disciplines[12]. Students engage with scholars across the university studying the ancient world while being embedded in the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology[12]. The program fosters relationships and partnerships with collecting institutions including tribal nations, involving collections research and exchange of information with tribal leaders and community representatives[12]. While the UCLA/Getty program represents graduate training rather than current job listings, it demonstrates how performance studies professionals with interests in material culture analysis might pursue additional specialized training to access conservation and preservation career tracks within cultural institutions[12].</p>
<h2>The Museum Studies and Arts Administration Specialist Track</h2>
<p>Museum studies graduate programs and arts administration specializations represent intermediate educational pathways for PhD-holding professionals transitioning from academic positions or completing PhDs without museum career focus[9]. The PhD program in Cultural Systems at educational institutions emphasizing cultural heritage and museum studies illustrates how multidisciplinary training integrates with museum professional practice[9]. The Cultural Heritage and Museum Studies track combines research and practice-oriented courses focusing on analysis, preservation, and promotion of cultural heritage with emphasis on museum studies and cultural institutions[9]. Through balanced academic training and applied experience, such programs prepare PhD candidates for careers in academia, museums, cultural institutions, creative industries, and private companies[9].</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary framework encourages innovation in cultural systems interpretation and management while fostering international research environments with mandatory on-campus first-year classes ensuring strong methodological foundations[9]. Subsequent years encourage international engagement supported by Erasmus+ programs and mobility agreements, fostering global collaboration and research opportunities[9]. For performance studies professionals, such programs offer structured opportunities to develop museum-specific expertise while maintaining scholarly rigor and theoretical sophistication[9].</p>
<h2>Broader Professional Networks and Career Development Resources</h2>
<p>The American Alliance of Museums represents the primary professional organization serving the entire museum field across art, history, science, zoos, and related institutions[46]. With more than 35,000 individual museum professionals and volunteers as members, AAM provides standards of excellence, knowledge sharing, professional networks, and career development opportunities[46]. The organization's recent emphasis on salary transparency in museum job postings reflects broader museum field commitments to equitable hiring and retention[46]. AAM's job board (JobHQ) provides centralized listing of museum positions across the country, with effective November 15, 2022 making salary information required for job postings—a significant development improving transparency for job seekers[46].</p>
<p>The Academy of Certified Archivists maintains employment listings and promotes professional standards for archivists across institutions[48]. Society of American Archivists provides parallel career support, annual conferences, continuing education, certificate programs, and graduate archival education resources[49]. These professional organizations offer mechanisms for networking, professional development, and job searching beyond individual institutional recruitment[48][49].</p>
<h2>Notable Research and Fellowship Opportunities</h2>
<p>Beyond permanent positions, fellowships and research opportunities provide pathways for advanced scholars to develop expertise and build credentials for museum careers[55][57]. The 2050 Artistic Fellowship at New York Theatre Workshop accepts up to six early-career theatermakers for year-long fellowships beginning June 2025, providing monthly meetings with fellowship cohort and NYTW community, access to rehearsal space, mentorship from NYTW artistic staff, participation in theatre's artistic life, and a three-day weekend retreat at start and end of fellowship[57]. Currently, 2050 Fellows receive both a $6,500 stipend and a $6,500 development fund supporting fellowship projects, theatre tickets, research, or travel[57].</p>
<p>The fellowship prioritizes early-career artists with unique voices representing underrepresented perspectives and emphasizes generative artists who author or direct work[57]. The program welcomes artists not currently in New York but requires willingness and ability to relocate to the NYC metro area for the fellowship year[57]. Application timeline includes preliminary application submission, invitation to submit full application (notified by late November), group interviews (early February), individual interviews (late February), and final decisions (end of March)[57].</p>
<h2>Recommendations for Theatre and Performance Studies PhD Professionals Seeking Museum Positions</h2>
<p>Based on comprehensive analysis of available positions, professional infrastructure, and career pathways, several strategic recommendations emerge for PhD-holding theatre and performance studies professionals targeting museum and cultural institution positions. First, recognizing that formal position titles may not explicitly require theatre and performance studies doctorates, professionals should develop clear narratives explaining how theatre scholarly expertise, research methodology, and public engagement skills transfer to museum roles[2][7][14][20][31]. Exhibition development, community programming, and curatorial research in museums benefit substantially from performance studies training in interpretation, audience engagement, and cultural analysis.</p>
<p>Second, pursuing specialized certification, additional graduate training, or fellowship experiences in museum studies, curatorial practice, archival science, or cultural administration strengthens candidacy for competitive positions[9][12][44]. Many museums value candidates combining disciplinary expertise with formal museum professional training[2][7][14]. Fellowship programs like those offered by the Mellon Foundation, prestigious museums, and cultural organizations provide both professional development and networking opportunities facilitating permanent position recruitment[55][57].</p>
<p>Third, developing expertise in collection management systems, database documentation, and digital scholarship tools enhances marketability[2][7][14][31]. Most museum positions require familiarity with TMS (The Museum System) collection management software, digital asset management, and archival documentation standards[2][7][14][31]. Theatre professionals without museum experience can acquire these technical competencies through courses, workshops, professional certifications, or volunteer positions[2][7][14][31].</p>
<p>Fourth, considering that academia continues recruiting theatre faculty members, exploring academic positions emphasizing research, performance production, and public engagement offers alternatives to museum positions while addressing similar scholarly and curatorial interests[1][13][21]. Many universities increasingly value faculty contributions to community engagement, public humanities, and archival research alongside traditional teaching and research[1][13][21].</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The job market for individuals with PhDs in theatre and performance studies seeking museum and cultural institution positions during November-December 2025 reveals a specialized but active landscape. While positions explicitly requiring or emphasizing theatre and performance studies expertise remain limited compared to positions in visual arts curation or archaeology, meaningful opportunities exist across curatorial, collections management, exhibition development, and public programming tracks[2][7][14][20][31]. Salary ranges from $26 to $29 per hour for entry-level positions through $91,838 annually for senior director roles demonstrate that museum careers offer competitive professional compensation[2][14][31].</p>
<p>The broader professional infrastructure supporting archivists and curators specializing in performing arts—including the American Theatre Archive Project, Dance/USA Archiving and Preservation, and Theatre Library Association—indicates sustained career pathways and professional development opportunities[44]. Graduate training programs increasingly recognize museum and cultural institution careers as legitimate trajectories for theatre and performance studies PhDs, explicitly incorporating museum studies, cultural heritage, and public humanities into doctoral curricula[3][9][21].</p>
<p>Strategic career development combining disciplinary expertise with formal museum professional training, technical competency in museum systems and archival methodology, and professional networking through established organizations positions theatre and performance studies PhDs to access rewarding careers in museum and cultural institution settings[2][7][14][44]. The intersection of theatre scholarship with contemporary museum emphases on community engagement, social justice, and public interpretation creates meaningful opportunities for advanced performance scholars to apply their expertise in service of cultural institutions' evolving missions.</p>
