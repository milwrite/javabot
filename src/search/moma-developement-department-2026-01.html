        <h1>The Museum of Modern Art's Development and Research Department: A Comprehensive Analysis of Institutional Research, Preservation, and Innovation Infrastructure</h1>
<p>The Museum of Modern Art operates one of the most sophisticated and comprehensive research infrastructures in the global museum world, comprising an integrated network of research departments, preservation facilities, archival centers, study centers, and innovative initiatives that fundamentally shape how the institution functions as both a guardian of modern and contemporary art and a catalyst for new knowledge creation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. This extensive research apparatus reflects MoMA's foundational commitment, established at its inception in 1929, to not merely collect and display art but to actively advance scholarly understanding, preserve cultural heritage, and expand the boundaries of curatorial practice and artistic exploration<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup>. From state-of-the-art conservation laboratories to cutting-edge digital humanities projects, from meticulously organized archival collections to globally distributed research initiatives exploring overlooked artistic traditions, MoMA's research and development infrastructure represents an institutional dedication to sustaining what the museum describes as "a library, archives, and conservation laboratory that are recognized as international centers of research"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. This report examines the multifaceted dimensions of MoMA's research and development operations, exploring how these various initiatives work in concert to support the museum's broader mission while simultaneously generating significant scholarly and cultural contributions that extend far beyond the institution's physical walls.</p>
<h2>The Foundational Role of MoMA R&D and Strategic Research Direction</h2>
<p>MoMA Research & Development, established as a dedicated initiative and led by Paola Antonelli, the museum's Senior Curator in the Department of Architecture and Design, operates as what the institution describes as "both crucible and catalyst for new ways of thinking and doing in museums"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. Rather than functioning as a traditional departmental unit bound by specific curatorial medium or historical period, MoMA R&D serves as a cross-cutting research resource that informs the museum's strategic planning across all departments and initiatives through various methodological approaches including digestive reviews of emerging scholarly and cultural discourse, thematic salon discussions, and both formal and informal meetings among staff and external partners<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. The vision animating this research division emphasizes the seamless integration of physical and digital space within the museum's operations, with particular attention to how MoMA might leverage its collections, expertise, and institutional platform to reach audiences and influence societal discourse well beyond the confines of its midtown Manhattan building<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Within this broad research framework, MoMA R&D advances several interconnected objectives that collectively demonstrate the museum's commitment to intellectual rigor and cultural relevance<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. The division presents stimulating ideas for new curatorial and educational programs that might otherwise remain overlooked or underexplored, develops innovative models of cultural engagement capable of resonating with both local and international audiences, and actively supports and informs the museum's expanding digital activities and operations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. Equally significant, MoMA R&D researches emerging partnerships and new products—both material and immaterial in nature—that can expand the institution's mission while generating creative, cultural, and financial capital that sustains and enhances its operations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a></sup>. This multivalent approach to research reflects a sophisticated understanding that modern museums operate within complex environments characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, shifting patterns of cultural consumption and meaning-making, and urgent questions about institutional responsibility and social relevance that demand continuous intellectual engagement and strategic innovation.</p>
<p>The R&D Salons represent one of MoMA's most visible and celebrated research initiatives, providing a structured yet flexible forum for exploring provocative and unexpected questions at the intersection of design, technology, culture, and society<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>. Over the past decade, these Salons have examined topics ranging from artificial intelligence and algorithmic culture to social justice, environmental sustainability, and the politics of representation in digital systems<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>. When scholar and technology ethnographer Kate Crawford presented at Salon 10 on "The Object, Connected" in 2014, she examined how networks render individuals "visible and vulnerable" in ways that complicate simple narratives of technological progress<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>. Later, contemporary artist Stephanie Dinkins presented her critical investigations into artificial intelligence at Salon 24, questioning whether algorithms trained on incomplete or biased data perpetuate "mass cultural erasure" of minority experiences and perspectives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>. These Salons emerged from a foundational impulse to explore museums' responsibility to local communities and society at large, evolving into a crucial mechanism through which MoMA positions itself as an institution capable of engaging with urgent contemporary issues through an artistic and cultural lens<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>. The breadth of topics addressed—from Elijah Anderson's examination of racial segregation and the "cosmopolitan canopy" to choreographer Shaun Leonardo's exploration of how anger masks fear in communities affected by gun violence—demonstrates MoMA's commitment to positioning art and design as crucial frameworks for understanding and potentially transforming contemporary social reality<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Conservation, Preservation, and Scientific Research Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The David Booth Conservation Center and Department represents one of MoMA's most technically sophisticated and internationally recognized research and preservation operations, responsible for the stewardship of the museum's entire collection of approximately 200,000 works spanning painting, sculpture, works on paper, photography, design objects, time-based media, and architectural documentation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. Established in 1958 in direct response to a destructive fire at the museum—a crisis that catalyzed institutional recognition of the fragility of modern and contemporary artworks and the necessity of professional conservation practice—the department has evolved into a comprehensive preservation operation extending far beyond the technical restoration of individual artworks<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The conservation department maintains sophisticated laboratory facilities and employs specialized conservators trained in the specific requirements of different media and artistic approaches, recognizing that paintings require fundamentally different treatment protocols than contemporary video installations or photographic materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Within the conservation infrastructure, specialized sections have emerged to address the distinct preservation challenges posed by different artistic media and materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. Conservators working with paintings and traditional media operate alongside specialists in works on paper, sculpture and three-dimensional objects, photography across various chemical and physical bases, and increasingly complex time-based media installations that raise unprecedented questions about what it means to preserve artworks that exist partially or wholly in immaterial, technological, or performative form<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The conservation department also houses a scientific research section dedicated to both advancing understanding of the museum's collection through material analysis and developing new conservation materials and methodologies that might extend the lifespan and stability of artworks facing uncertain environmental futures<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. This combination of practical conservation work and theoretical research positions MoMA's conservation department not merely as a service operation maintaining the museum's holdings but as a center of scholarly inquiry into the fundamental nature of artistic materials, degradation processes, and preservation possibilities.</p>
<p>A particularly significant institutional achievement in conservation infrastructure was the establishment of The Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center, an $11.2-million state-of-the-art facility opened in 1996 on a thirty-eight-acre estate in Hamlin, Pennsylvania<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup>. This specialized facility emerged from practical necessity and visionary planning, as the sheer size and particular conservation requirements of MoMA's film collection—comprising more than 30,000 titles making it one of the world's finest museum archives of international film art—made storage in midtown Manhattan physically impossible<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup>. The Film Preservation Center comprises two distinct buildings featuring fifty-eight individually climate-controlled vaults, a 7,900-square-foot facility for MoMA's approximately 5,000 fragile nitrate films dating from 1894 to 1951, and a larger 28,000-square-foot main building housing approximately 20,000 titles on acetate-based "safety stock"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup>. Each vault operates with its own environmental controls because different types of film require markedly different storage conditions—color films preserve better at temperatures just above freezing while black-and-white and nitrate films can be stored at 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and all film materials benefit from low humidity levels<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup>. This granular approach to environmental control reflects the sophisticated understanding that film preservation demands precisely calibrated physical conditions combined with professional expertise in chemical stability and material science.</p>
<p>The conservation department's work extends beyond the technical processes of preservation into broader advisory functions within the museum's operations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. Conservators advise on environmental controls throughout the museum's galleries and storage facilities, participate in planning special exhibitions to ensure that particularly fragile artworks can be safely displayed, and manage the complex logistics of travel, packing, and installation when artworks circulate to other institutions or exhibitions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. These activities collectively constitute what the museum describes as an "overall preventative program, which seeks to maintain the collection for future generations," reflecting a philosophy that conservation is not merely crisis intervention but rather an ongoing commitment to creating conditions in which artworks might endure and remain accessible to future audiences<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. Conservators and scientists within the department actively engage in scholarly research related to exhibitions and collections, contributing to the museum's intellectual life and ensuring that technical expertise informs curatorial decision-making and exhibition interpretation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Matters in Media Art project, launched in 2003 through collaboration between MoMA, SFMOMA, Tate, and New Art Trust, demonstrates how the conservation department contributes to broader professional conversations about the stewardship of time-based artworks<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a></sup>. This multi-phase initiative developed guidelines for the care of video, film, audio, and computer-based installations—artistic forms that, unlike traditional paintings or sculptures, often exist as complex technological systems only fully realized in their installed state<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a></sup>. The project recognized that whereas internationally agreed standards exist for handling traditional artworks, no such standards existed for time-based media works, prompting the consortium to develop practical methodologies addressing how to loan these works, acquire them responsibly, install them with appropriate technological specifications, and preserve their core intentions across technological obsolescence and format evolution<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a></sup>. This initiative reflects the contemporary conservation challenge that emerges when artistic practice increasingly incorporates ephemeral, immaterial, or technology-dependent elements that resist conventional preservation approaches.</p>
<h2>Archives, Libraries, and Study Centers: Comprehensive Access Infrastructure</h2>
<p>MoMA's archival and library holdings constitute what the institution claims as "the leading concentration of research material on modern art in the world," representing a vast repository of primary source documents, scholarly materials, and curatorial resources supporting both internal research and external scholarly inquiry<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. The Museum of Modern Art Archives, established as an internationally recognized research center for modern and contemporary art, collects, preserves, and makes accessible nearly ninety years of institutional historical records, forty years of MoMA PS1 documentation, and numerous private archives and papers of artists, galleries, dealers, art historians, critics, and other cultural figures<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a></sup>. These holdings extend across 2,500 linear feet of historical documentation spanning from the museum's founding in 1929 through the present, encompassing everything from institutional correspondence and administrative records to curatorial files, exhibition documentation, and artists' personal papers<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The scope and significance of MoMA's archival collections becomes apparent when examining the specific holdings maintained by the museum<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup>. The Archives possess the Lillie P. Bliss Scrapbook documenting early twentieth-century modern art collecting, Contemporary Arts Council Annual Reports spanning from 1986 to 1998, Department of Education records from 1967 to 1982, extensive Film Exhibition Files from 1936 to 1990, and the Museum's original charters and founding documents from 1929<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup>. Additionally, the institution maintains specialized collections including Jasper Johns Drawings, miscellaneous awards documentation, detailed records of the International Council and International Program including over three hundred separate exhibitions, MoMA PS1 archival materials spanning curatorial, exhibition, press, publications, and administrative records, original photographic archives spanning from 1929 to the present containing approximately 50,000 digitized images with art documentation and ephemera, and extensive press office records from 1927 to 2010<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup>. The Archives also holds restricted materials including bank books from 1934 to 1981, cashier's safe records, trustee and committee minutes spanning decades, and other sensitive institutional documents<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Complementing the Archives, MoMA's Library maintains over 320,000 items including books, artist-produced books, periodicals, and extensive individual files on more than 90,000 artists, establishing it as a fundamental resource for scholarship on modern and contemporary art history<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. The Library's collections span from foundational texts in art history and theory to contemporary scholarly works, exhibition catalogues, periodicals tracking current artistic and critical discourse, and specialized reference materials supporting the museum's curatorial departments<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. This extraordinary collection reflects a deliberate institutional commitment, established at MoMA's founding, to sustain intellectual infrastructure necessary for serious engagement with modern and contemporary artistic practice.</p>
<p>Beyond these general archival and library holdings, MoMA operates specialized Study Centers within each of its curatorial departments, designed to provide researchers, scholars, students, and the general public with direct access to original artworks and related documentation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The Lily Auchincloss Study Center for Architecture and Design permits researchers to examine reference materials, architectural drawings, models and photographs, design objects and graphics, and the comprehensive Mies van der Rohe Archive, available by appointment only with email contact to the department<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Drawings and Prints Study Center provides access to the museum's extensive collection of works on paper including drawings, prints, illustrated books, artist's books, and multiples, with curatorial files on individual works available for consultation and appointments scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00 to 3:30 p.m.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The Joseph and Sylvia Slifka Painting and Sculpture Study Center maintains curatorial files on more than 4,000 paintings and sculptures within the collection, with materials potentially including archival photographs, label and catalog texts, press clippings and releases, and correspondence, available for appointment-based consultation on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Erna and Victor Hasselblad Photography Study Center provides specialized access to the museum's photographic holdings by appointment, available only from October through May on Wednesday afternoons with a minimum four-week advance notice for individual appointments and three-month advance notice for class visits<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The Media and Performance Study Center facilitates viewings of collection works and related documentation for both individual scholars and educational groups by appointment, operating Wednesday through Thursday from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. with a minimum four-week advance notice requirement<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The Celeste Bartos International Film Study Center, located at the Film Preservation Center in Pennsylvania, offers screening facilities for viewing films, access to screenplays and dialogue continuities, extensive files of reviews and program notes, reference books, special collections, film indexes, and current periodicals, with materials made available exclusively to scholars, researchers, and students by appointment<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup>. The Film Stills Archive, also located at the Film Preservation Center, provides researchers and scholars access to film stills by appointment, requiring provision of specific film information and personality names for identification and retrieval<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This network of specialized study centers operationalizes a crucial institutional philosophy: that serious engagement with artworks and historical materials demands direct encounter and that researchers and students merit access to original materials, not merely secondary representations or descriptions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>. The appointment-based access model, while requiring advance planning, reflects a deliberate calibration between preservation imperatives and accessibility commitments, ensuring that fragile materials receive appropriate environmental controls and security while remaining genuinely available to those undertaking serious scholarly work.</p>
<h2>Global Research Initiatives and International Perspectives</h2>
<p>MoMA's research infrastructure extends far beyond its physical location and specialized collections through several coordinated initiatives designed to foster global perspectives on modern and contemporary art history and expand the museum's understanding of artistic practices occurring outside North American and Western European contexts. The Contemporary and Modern Art Perspectives in a Global Age (C-MAP) initiative, founded in 2009, represents a particularly ambitious effort to generate systematic research on art histories and artistic practices from diverse geographical regions and to integrate these perspectives into the museum's collecting, exhibition, and educational activities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup>. Unlike traditional area studies approaches that might compartmentalize knowledge about different regions, C-MAP operates as an internal cross-departmental research program harnessing resources from within the museum and cultivating relationships with cultural institutions, scholars, and artists internationally<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. The program, which includes staff from across the museum's departments, organizes its research through geographically focused groups examining modern and contemporary art produced in Africa, Southeast and East Asia, and Bombay/Mumbai, with previous groups having addressed Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Western Asia<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The C-MAP Africa group, led by Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi and supported by C-MAP Africa Fellow Beya Othmani, focuses on artistic practices and institutional formations across the African continent within an expanded timeframe extending from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. This group's research adopts an artist-centric approach, examining individual artistic production and specifically inviting still-living artists to share their experiences of collectives on the continent, thereby centering living memory and subjective experience alongside archival research<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. The C-MAP Southeast and East Asia group, led by Stuart Comer, Roxana Marcoci, and C-MAP Southeast and East Asia Fellow Carlos Quijon, currently researches art and architecture of Southeast Asian regions and diasporas including Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines, focusing on art histories, contemporary practices, and conceptual frameworks that might move beyond categorical and canonical understandings of the region's artistic traditions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. The C-MAP Bombay/Mumbai group, led by Lucy Gallun and C-MAP Bombay/Mumbai Fellow Ananya Sikand with advisor Homi K. Bhabha from Harvard University, investigates the city as a dynamic constellation examining the metropolis's role in creating art, architecture, cinema, design, literature, music, and theater from the original archipelagic Portuguese formation through colonialism to the contemporary megacity<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Operationally, C-MAP generates knowledge through multiple interconnected mechanisms<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup>. Monthly meetings bring together MoMA staff with invited scholars, artists, and curators presenting cutting-edge research, enabling institutional staff to establish contacts, exchange experiences, and acquire firsthand knowledge of diverse geographies and artistic contexts<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. The program fosters strategic partnerships with key cultural institutions worldwide, facilitating the development of deeper understanding of the museum's own collections within broader historical and cultural contexts while enabling future acquisitions and programs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. C-MAP also organizes periodic seminars enabling program members to think deeply about the museum's global views of modern and contemporary art, with both internal and public components that translate research into broader educational engagement<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. The online platform post: notes on art in a global context, launched in 2013 as the public face of C-MAP's research, encourages in-depth global explorations of artistic practices and demonstrates how modernism is continually being redefined through diverse contexts and perspectives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. Through essays, interviews, archival materials, and newly translated sources, post foregrounds contributions from individuals and institutions around the world, making less-accessible episodes of art history available to broad public audiences<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The International Program, established in 1952 to expand MoMA's international outreach, represents another significant dimension of the museum's globally oriented research infrastructure<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a></sup>. The program maintains a worldwide network of scholars, artists, curators, and arts institutions while advancing research-driven programs designed to address global art perspectives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a></sup>. Operating through the Primary Documents series of publications devoted to different world regions, the International Curatorial Institute providing annual two-week learning intensives, and the internal research initiative C-MAP itself, the International Program actively fosters learning, critical discourse, and exchange addressing museological, curatorial, and artistic practices around the world<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a></sup>. By working across the museum's departments, organizing workshops with international guests at MoMA, and facilitating group travel abroad for museum staff, the International Program ensures that global perspectives inform institutional thinking and practice rather than remaining isolated or peripheral to the museum's core operations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The Cisneros Institute and Regional Expertise Development</h2>
<p>The Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Research Institute for the Study of Art from Latin America exemplifies how MoMA develops specialized research platforms dedicated to advancing understanding of specific artistic traditions while building institutional capacity around overlooked or underrepresented areas of art history<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup>. Established to study the more than 250 works donated to MoMA by the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, the Institute operates as a platform dedicated to stimulating, supporting, and disseminating new understandings of Latin American modern and contemporary art in relationship to broader cultural issues within global context<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>. The Institute pursues this mission through sustained research dialogues, rigorous scholarly investigation, and fellowship programs that empower artists, scholars, and curators from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the enrichment of art histories and artistic discourses across borders<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Cisneros Institute's fellowship programs represent a particularly innovative approach to developing scholarly expertise and expanding curatorial perspectives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup>. The Artists Research Fellowship supports artists undertaking projects advancing understanding of Latin American modern and contemporary artistic practice. The Curatorial Research Fellowship, offered yearly to MoMA and MoMA PS1 curators, directly aims to foster new understandings of Latin American art that will inform future exhibitions, acquisitions, publications, and public programs while expanding the museum's curatorial perspectives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup>. The Latin American Collection Fellowships support scholars and researchers working with the institute's collections and materials. Through these programs, the institute has supported projects including Jody Graf's 2024 research on Indigenous artists and collectives in Chiapas and Oaxaca, examining how artists, media collectives, and printmaking shops have informed efforts toward political autonomy, land sovereignty, and Indigenous knowledge stewardship, while also exploring how these practitioners navigate the complex dynamics of increased global interest in Indigenous art<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup>. Similarly, the institute supported Thomas Lax's 2021 research project "Searching for Yemanjá," exploring the figure of the ocean in visual arts of the African diaspora and the notion of motherhood in Black radical intellectual tradition, demonstrating how Latin American artistic contexts frequently intersect with broader diasporic and transnational artistic networks<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Ambasz Institute, named after architect and visionary Emilio Ambasz, represents another specialized research platform addressing urgent contemporary concerns through the lens of architectural and design practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a></sup>. Established to foster dialogue, promote conversation, and facilitate research about relationships between the built and natural environment, the Institute aims to make visible and accessible the urgent need for ecological recalibration at a moment when the Anthropocene has undermined any semblance of balance between human endeavor and ecological stability<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a></sup>. The Institute's interdisciplinary mission brings together architects, designers, policy makers, social thinkers, historians, and the general public to explore creative approaches to design at all scales of the built environment—buildings, cities, landscapes, and objects—with emphasis on understanding their joint relationship to the natural environment<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a></sup>. Operationally, the Institute pursues this research through public lectures, conferences and symposia, and digital equivalents designed to reach globally distributed audiences while synthesizing research and programmatic initiatives with current sociopolitical issues, thereby helping solidify cultural and art institutions' relevance for today's diverse audiences<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Fellowship and Residency Programs: Cultivating Next-Generation Scholarship</h2>
<p>Recognizing that institutional research capacity extends beyond permanent staff and that important scholarly work benefits from infusions of fresh perspectives, MoMA maintains several significant fellowship and residency programs designed to mentor emerging scholars, artists, and curators while supporting innovative research initiatives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a></sup>. These programs strategically position MoMA not merely as a repository of existing knowledge but as an institution actively committed to cultivating the next generation of art historians, curators, and creative practitioners capable of advancing contemporary understanding of modern and contemporary art.</p>
<p>The MoMA Scholars in Residence program, supported by the Ford Foundation, invites three acclaimed thought leaders annually to join the museum for a one-year term pursuing independent research projects with full access to MoMA's collections, archives, and library in dialogue with museum staff<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a></sup>. The program specifically seeks scholars and makers offering fresh perspectives on modern and contemporary art history and supported individuals with demonstrated records of achievement contributing significant intellectual work to their respective fields<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a></sup>. The 2024–25 cohort comprises Nathalie Joachim, a Grammy-nominated performer and composer exploring her Haitian heritage; Saloni Mathur, a scholar of modern and contemporary South Asian art focusing on migration, diaspora, and postcolonial criticism; and Joseph M. Pierce, an associate professor examining Hispanic languages, Indigenous worlding, and repair, who is also a citizen of the Cherokee Nation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a></sup>. By intentionally recruiting scholars whose research extends beyond traditional art historical frameworks to engage with music, diaspora studies, Indigenous thought, and non-Western epistemologies, the program ensures that MoMA's research infrastructure remains engaged with contemporary scholarly and creative practice occurring across disciplines and geographical contexts.</p>
<p>The Mellon-Marron Research Consortium (MRC) represents another crucial institutional partnership advancing graduate training in art history while sustaining research infrastructure at major American universities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. Established as a partnership between MoMA and five regional graduate art history programs—Columbia University, The Graduate Center at City University of New York, the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, Princeton University, and Yale University—and supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron, the MRC provides a framework through which MoMA participates in training the next generation of art historians and curators<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. The MRC Fellows program represents the consortium's core initiative, selecting one PhD candidate from each of the five partner institutions annually to work full-time with an experienced MoMA curator on a scholarly curatorial project<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. Beyond gaining hands-on experience in museum practice and receiving mentorship from established curators, fellows benefit from professional development programs and opportunities to network with colleagues in other consortium-member graduate programs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. The 2024–25 fellows include JaBrea Patterson-West working in Painting and Sculpture, Cathryn Jijón in Drawings and Prints, Marcos García Mouronte in Architecture and Design, Adela Kim in Painting and Sculpture, and Pujan Karambeigi in Painting and Sculpture<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond individual fellowships, the MRC organizes semiannual Study Sessions designed to function as incubators for new ideas and approaches to key holdings in the museum's collection<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. These collaborative sessions provide greater access to collection objects for a community of art historians while developing strong ties across the consortium, with participation including MoMA curators and conservators, current MRC Fellows, faculty members and graduate students from the five partner universities, and invited guest scholars<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. Study Session topics demonstrate the breadth of curatorial and scholarly concerns engaging the consortium, with recent sessions focusing on Native artists of the Americas (2025), collage tactics (2024), climate and environmental concerns in the collection (2021–22), performance and performance-based work (2017), African American artists (2016), Picasso's sculpture (2015), and work by Jean Dubuffet (2014)<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. Through these varied study objects, the MRC ensures that graduate students and established scholars working across different universities and career stages remain engaged with the museum's collection as a dynamic resource for generating new interpretations and historical understandings.</p>
<p>The Adobe Creative Residency at MoMA, established in 2015 through partnership between Adobe Foundation and the museum, awards a yearlong sponsored residency to a New York City–based artist with demonstrated commitment to engaging communities as part of their practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup>. The residency provides vital resources including mentorship, access to the museum's archives and resources, curatorial guidance, and staff expertise enabling the resident artist to realize a community-engaged project concluding with public presentation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup>. The 2025 Adobe Creative Resident, Samora Pinderhughes, a multidisciplinary artist, composer, and filmmaker examining sociopolitical issues, is proposing creation of sonic healing rooms facilitating the grieving and healing needs of people who have experienced structural violence including poverty, environmental racism, policing, detention, and carceral systems<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup>. Pinderhughes's project, collaborating with community organizations across New York City, uses performance, installation, film, songcraft, and language to shape and hold space for community engagement, collective exchange, and participatory action, reflecting the program's commitment to positioning art practice as a vehicle for social understanding and potential transformation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Digital Innovation and Emerging Technologies in Research Practice</h2>
<p>MoMA's research infrastructure has increasingly engaged with digital technologies and emerging platforms as mechanisms for both conducting scholarly investigation and making research accessible to broader audiences beyond the institutional walls. The museum's digital offerings have expanded dramatically, reflecting institutional recognition that contemporary research and educational practice necessarily engages digital platforms as fundamental rather than supplementary dimensions of knowledge creation and dissemination<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>. MoMA's website and digital platforms contain approximately 50,000 digitized images from the museum's collections and archives, including letters, art documentation, ephemera, and images of artists and art-world figures, thereby making accessible materials that might otherwise remain confined to physical archival locations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup>. The museum's online collection currently provides access to more than 84,000 works from a total collection of approximately 200,000 artworks, with exhibition history including individual pages containing digitized exhibition catalogues, installation photographs, press releases, and master checklists for more than 5,000 exhibitions at MoMA and MoMA PS1<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The museum's Magazine, launched in 2019 as an online editorial platform on MoMA.org, offers original content and commissioned projects from artists and cultural influencers through audio, video, cartoons, photo essays, poetry, and longform writing, establishing a contemporary digital space for sustained engagement with curatorial and artistic thinking<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup>. The museum's YouTube channel distributes MoMA-produced video content including collections playlists, exhibition materials, conservation documentation, and film programming, alongside special series developed by the creative team including "At the Museum," "How to See," "In the Studio," "Artist Stories," "Fashion as Design," and "Modern Art and Ideas"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup>. Since 2005, MoMA has offered one of the largest inclusive distributions of an art museum audio tour worldwide, with the Bloomberg Connects app providing access to audio playlists, verbal descriptions of artworks, assistive listening technology, and transcripts, making collection engagement accessible to visitors with diverse accessibility needs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup>.</p>
<p>MoMA's engagement with artificial intelligence and emerging digital platforms represents a particularly significant dimension of contemporary research practice, reflecting the museum's interest in understanding and leveraging new technological possibilities while critically examining their implications<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>. Artist Refik Anadol's acquisition "Unsupervised — Machine Hallucinations — MoMA," a groundbreaking digital artwork using generative artificial intelligence to interpret and transform more than 200 years of art from MoMA's collection, exemplifies how the museum engages emerging technologies as subjects for both curatorial inquiry and artistic experimentation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>. For this work, Anadol trained a sophisticated machine-learning model to interpret publicly available data of MoMA's collection, allowing the model to conceptually "walk" through the artwork database while reimagining the history of modern art and hypothetically dreaming about what might have been and what might come<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>. The resulting installation, displayed on a large-scale media wall in the museum's ground-floor Gund Lobby, continuously generates new forms while responding to environmental inputs including light, movement, acoustics, and outdoor weather<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>. This work functions not as transparent representation but as philosophical meditation—what the museum describes as "visionary" rather than merely realistic—exploring fantasy, hallucination, and irrationality to create alternate understandings of art-making itself while the underlying work is tokenized on the blockchain as a distributed digital ledger creating public record of Anadol's artistic practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>MoMA's MoMA Postcard project represents another significant engagement with emerging blockchain technologies as a mechanism for collective creativity and participatory art-making<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup>. This blockchain-based participatory art project extends an invitation for anyone to learn, experiment, collaborate, and create within a decentralized digital framework, experimenting with how blockchain technologies might enable new forms of cultural engagement and collective meaning-making<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup>. Ian Cheng's acquisition "3FACE," an adaptive artwork grounded in the artist's interest in human capacity to relate to change, similarly engages blockchain technologies by analyzing wallet data of web3 owners' online behavior to generate visual portraits of forces composing owner personality<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup>. These investments in emerging technologies reflect the museum's understanding that contemporary artistic practice increasingly engages computational systems, distributed digital networks, and decentralized platforms, requiring institutional research infrastructure capable of grappling seriously with these forms while critically examining their cultural, social, and economic implications.</p>
<h2>Conservation of Holocaust-Era Provenance and Ethical Collecting Research</h2>
<p>Among the most ethically significant dimensions of MoMA's research infrastructure is the Provenance Research Project, established to examine the ownership history and acquisition circumstances of artworks created before 1946 and acquired after 1932, thereby addressing the institution's moral responsibility regarding potential Nazi-era looting and unlawful appropriation of cultural property<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-17" id="cite-17">17</a></sup>. In April 2000, MoMA's director Glenn D. Lowry joined other American museum directors in presenting testimony before the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets, reaffirming the museum community's commitment to assisting in discovering unlawfully appropri</p>
