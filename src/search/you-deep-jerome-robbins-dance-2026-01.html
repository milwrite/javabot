        <h1>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division of the New York Public Library: Comprehensive Exploration of the World's Largest Dance Archive and Its Revolutionary Oral History Project</h1>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division of the New York Public Library stands as the world's largest dance archive and library, housing an international and extensive collection that spans seven centuries of dance history<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup>. At the heart of this monumental institution lies the Dance Oral History Project, a dynamic collection of over 600 interviews initiated and recorded since 1974 that has fundamentally transformed how dance history is documented, preserved, and transmitted to future generations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. This project represents a paradigmatic shift in archival practice within the dance field, recognizing that the ephemeral nature of movement-based art forms requires innovative methodologies and dedicated institutional commitment to capture the lived experiences, creative processes, and cultural knowledge of dance practitioners across all genres and styles. Through careful curation, technological advancement, and community-centered approaches to documentation, the Jerome Robbins Dance Division has established itself not merely as a repository of historical materials but as an active participant in shaping the narrative of dance in America and globally.</p>
<h2>Historical Foundations and Institutional Development of the Dance Division</h2>
<h3>Origins and the Visionary Work of Genevieve Oswald</h3>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division emerged from a modest beginning in 1944 when the New York Public Library first began partitioning dance-related materials from the music division, recognizing that these materials possessed sufficient scope and significance to warrant specialized treatment<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup>. However, the true transformative moment came in 1947 when the institution hired Genevieve Oswald, known affectionately as "Gegi" by colleagues and the dance community<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup>. Oswald was initially brought on as a musicologist with a bachelor's degree in music from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, yet her passion for dance and her prescient vision would shape the institution's trajectory for the next four decades<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. When Director Carl Smith of the Music Division initially suggested to Oswald that she might "do a little something with dance" for only a couple of hours per day, he could not have anticipated that this modest suggestion would catalyze the development of what would eventually become the world's most comprehensive archive devoted to the documentation of dance<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. Oswald's response to this opportunity was characterized by what she described as a "wonderful sense of elation, because I loved the dance"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>From the outset, Oswald demonstrated extraordinary institutional vision and strategic acumen in building the collection. She recognized that the dance collection should be treated as an autonomous collection of its own rather than remaining subordinated within the music division, and she actively advocated for the need to not merely film dance but to create a secure physical place to preserve and safeguard these materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. One of Oswald's most significant early contributions was her work with dance critic Walter Terry of the New York Herald Tribune, who introduced her to the pioneering dancer and choreographer Ted Shawn<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. This connection proved instrumental, as Shawn became an enduring friend to the emerging Dance Collection and donated his own extensive personal papers and materials to the nascent organization<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. Through similar relationships and determined outreach efforts—including writing to individuals identified in telephone directories from different cities—Oswald successfully acquired major foundational collections including the Irma Duncan Collection by 1957<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Expansion and Professionalization Through the Mid-Twentieth Century</h3>
<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Oswald spearheaded the expansion of the Dance Division through the establishment of the Original Documentation program, which began systematically recording live dance performances<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. This initiative represented a significant conceptual advance, as it acknowledged that capturing live performance through video documentation was essential for preserving the ephemeral art of dance. The division's first two decades were primarily devoted to building what Oswald termed "a skeleton of materials"—establishing foundational holdings across multiple genres and historical periods<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. Oswald's comprehensive vision extended beyond classical ballet to embrace all facets of the dance field, including concert dance, classical forms from around the world, social and ritual dances, pedagogy, history, and anthropology<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. This omnivorous collecting philosophy established a precedent that remains central to the division's identity and practice today.</p>
<p>A transformative moment in the division's institutional status occurred in the early 1970s when the Dance Collection achieved independence as a separate division of the New York Public Library, elevated to the same administrative level as the Music Division itself, with its own distinct location within the Lincoln Center library complex<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. This administrative reorganization formalized what Oswald had been constructing operationally—a recognition that dance materials and dance scholarship constituted a field sufficiently substantial and distinctive to warrant dedicated institutional resources and specialized professional expertise. When the Library for the Performing Arts opened at Lincoln Center in 1973, the Dance Division relocated to the third floor of the new facility, securing state-of-the-art accommodations for preserving and providing access to its growing collections<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Oswald retired from her position at NYPL in 1987 after forty years of service, during which she had transformed a small, marginalized collection into the world's leading repository of dance materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>. She was honored with the title of Curator Emerita, a recognition of her foundational contributions to the field. Oswald passed away in 2021 at the remarkable age of 97, but her legacy continues to animate the division's work and vision<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a></sup>. The division itself was renamed the Jerome Robbins Dance Division in honor of the celebrated choreographer, dancer, director, and producer who had worked collaboratively with Oswald in advancing the division's mission and whose archive forms one of the collection's jewels<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Collections and Archival Holdings</h2>
<h3>Scope and Magnitude of the Archive</h3>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division currently houses one of the most extensive and diverse collections of dance-related materials anywhere in the world<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup>. The division's holdings encompass more than 44,000 books about dance, though these printed materials represent only a small fraction of its vast and multifaceted collections<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. The archive spans seven centuries of dance history and includes materials drawn from international sources, reflecting the division's commitment to documenting dance as a global cultural phenomenon while maintaining particular strength in American dance traditions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Beyond books, the division maintains comprehensive holdings of papers and manuscript collections, moving image and audio recordings, clippings and program files, original prints, costume and set designs, and extensive photographic materials documenting performers, companies, and performances across all major genres and many specialized or vernacular dance traditions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The breadth of the division's collecting is reflected in its acquisition of materials related to figures ranging from early twentieth-century pioneers like Ted Shawn, Martha Graham, and Doris Humphrey to contemporary choreographers and performers working in ballet, modern dance, jazz dance, tap dance, hip-hop, and numerous other genres. The collection includes rare historical manuscripts, such as Renaissance Italian dance manuscripts including the "Giorgio" manuscript and the "Il Papa" manuscript, as well as contemporary digital materials capturing performances and interviews with living artists<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Cia Fornaroli Collection, given by Walter Toscanini, contains more than 3,300 rare books and tens of thousands of libretti, scores, manuscripts, prints, photographs, clippings, and playbills, with particular strength in nineteenth-century Italian dance materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Major Named Collections and Their Significance</h3>
<p>The division houses numerous major named collections that represent the careers and legacies of significant choreographers, dancers, and dance figures. The Jerome Robbins Collection itself comprises business and personal correspondence, photographs, set and costume designs, engravings, scrapbooks, films, videotapes, audiotapes, and selections from Robbins's personal library, documenting his prolific career spanning ballet, theater, film, and television<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Mikhail Baryshnikov Archive, acquired in 2011, contains more than 1,000 films, videotapes, and audiotapes documenting Nureyev's life and career, though the designation reflects an earlier cataloging attribution<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Merce Cunningham Collection preserves photographs, films, videotapes, audiotapes, posters, theatre programs, dance company production files, and choreographic notes spanning from the 1930s to the present<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Agnes de Mille Collection includes films, photographs, choreographic notes, and manuscripts documenting her career as a dancer, choreographer, and writer<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The American Ballet Theatre Archives represent one of the most substantial institutional collections within the division, containing more than one million letters and production, booking, and tour files spanning from 1936 to 1967, supplemented by more recent acquisitions that document more than 700 artists and 300 ballets<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Lincoln Kirstein Collection includes photographs, press clippings, letters, and designs mirroring the development of American modern dance<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The Denishawn and Humphrey-Weidman Collections preserve materials documenting the foundational figures and pioneers of American modern dance, including the Doris Humphrey Collection, which contains more than 1,000 letters and manuscripts about Humphrey's personal and professional life<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup>. The American Tap Dance Foundation collection, one of the most recent major acquisitions, comprises 27.61 linear feet of materials along with 9.42 terabytes of computer files, representing a significant commitment to preserving and documenting this important American dance tradition<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-34" id="cite-34">34</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The Dance Oral History Project: Origins, Philosophy, and Development</h2>
<h3>Foundational Conception and Initial Implementation</h3>
<p>The Dance Oral History Project was launched in 1974 by the Jerome Robbins Dance Division as a direct response to what institutional leaders recognized as a critical gap in the documentation of dance history<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup>. The project emerged from the fundamental recognition that dance, as an ephemeral art form that exists primarily in the body of the performer and only in the present moment of its execution, faces unique challenges in historical preservation and transmission<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. While performances can be recorded on film or video, the lived experiences of dancers, the creative processes through which choreographers developed their work, the social and cultural contexts within which different dance traditions emerged and flourished, and the relationships and collaborations that shaped dance history could only be adequately captured through sustained, in-depth oral interviews<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. The Oral History Project thus represented an institutional commitment to recognizing the voice and subjective experience of dance practitioners as a legitimate and essential form of historical documentation.</p>
<p>The project's initial focus reflected the institutional priorities and scholarly interests of its founding era. Interviews were first initiated around the lives and careers of eight major figures in dance history: Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, Lucia Chase, Alexandra Danilova, Ninette de Valois, Martha Graham, Alicia Markova, and Leonide Massine<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup>. These initial narrators represented the most celebrated figures in twentieth-century ballet and modern dance, the titans of the field whose accomplishments were widely recognized and whose stories were considered foundational to any historical understanding of contemporary dance. The founding Oral History Coordinator was Lesley Farlow, who would work with Genevieve Oswald to establish the project's protocols, ethical frameworks, and operational procedures<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Dance Oral History Project has developed into a dynamic collection of over 600 interviews conducted over more than fifty years<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup>. The project explicitly seeks to enrich the Jerome Robbins Dance Division's archive with the voices of dancers, choreographers, educators, collaborators, scholars, and producers working in a wide array of genres and styles within the broader dance field<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. While the project maintains a strong focus on New York-based dance artists—a concentration reflecting both institutional location and the significance of New York as a global dance capital—its scope encompasses dance practitioners across the United States and internationally<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. In this way, the Dance Oral History Project reflects what the institution describes as the "rich ecosystem of the dance field," recognizing that dance history encompasses contributions from artists working across multiple genres, performance contexts, and cultural traditions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Methodology and Selection Criteria</h3>
<p>The Dance Oral History Project employs a carefully considered methodology designed to identify narrators whose participation would yield historically significant documentation while also addressing gaps and underrepresentation within existing archival holdings<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup>. The project generally focuses on late-career and retired dance artists, typically over the age of sixty, on the premise that such individuals possess extended career histories, accumulated wisdom and perspective, and readiness to reflect deeply on their artistic lives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. However, age is not an absolute criterion; the project also considers artistic achievement, historical influence, and demonstrated contributions to passing along the art form to future generations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The selection process incorporates several important considerations beyond mere prominence or fame. The project explicitly considers whether a person's story may be at risk in some way due to illness, diminishing participation in a particular dance form, or historical underrepresentation within the archive<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. This criterion reflects a sophisticated understanding of archival responsibility that extends beyond simply documenting the most famous or celebrated figures in dance. Rather, the project recognizes that some artists, particularly those working in marginalized or endangered dance traditions, in innovative or avant-garde contexts, or in genres that receive less institutional attention, have stories that are particularly vulnerable to disappearance unless deliberately and intentionally documented. By explicitly prioritizing underrepresented voices and perspectives, the project works to create a more comprehensive and equitable historical record of dance practice.</p>
<p>All Dance Oral History Project interviews typically consist of multiple sessions, often lasting between five to seven hours in total length<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup>. These extended interviews allow for a depth and complexity of conversation that brief single-session recordings cannot achieve. The unedited nature of the interviews—preserving them in their original form rather than condensing, summarizing, or selectively editing them—ensures that researchers have access to complete testimonies with all their digressions, emotional dimensions, and contextual detail<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. All recordings and transcripts are accessible to researchers on the third floor of the Library for the Performing Arts, and as of recent years, over 50 full-length interviews have been made publicly available through digital platforms, with the promise that additional materials will continue to be released<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Special Projects and Thematic Initiatives</h3>
<p>The Dance Oral History Project has expanded beyond its core mission of documenting individual artists' lives to encompass specialized projects that address specific gaps in documentation or respond to contemporary cultural moments and concerns. These special projects represent the project's evolution and its willingness to extend its methodology to address pressing historiographical needs.</p>
<p>#### Street, Club, and Hip-Hop Dance Documentation</p>
<p>In 2020, the Jerome Robbins Dance Division launched an ongoing series of oral histories specifically focused on groundbreaking and prominent figures of street, club, and early hip-hop dance styles from the 1970s onward<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. This initiative represents a significant institutional commitment to documenting Black and Brown cultural practices that have historically been marginalized within academic and institutional dance discourse, despite their profound influence on contemporary dance and popular culture more broadly<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup>. The project explicitly recognizes hip-hop as an American culture that grew from the innovation of Black and Brown youth in New York City, as a way of being, moving, identity, practice, and theory, and as emerging from social gatherings and expressing means for social justice and community building<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To ensure authentic and culturally appropriate documentation, the project partners annually with artist liaisons who are themselves active in preserving the legacy of hip-hop dance styles and maintaining community relationships within these artistic communities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. The initial artist liaisons included legendary B-girl and co-founder of Full Circle Souljahs Ana "Rokafella" Garcia, Ladies of Hip Hop Executive Director Michele Byrd-McPhee, award-winning dance artist LaTasha Barnes, and notable B-girl and oral historian MiRi Park<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. These collaborations ensure that the selection and documentation process remains grounded in community knowledge and cultural authenticity rather than being imposed from outside institutional frameworks.</p>
<p>As of 2020, the project has recorded approximately twenty long-form oral histories with street and club dance practitioners, with ongoing efforts to continue this documentation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup>. These interviews capture the perspectives of iconic figures such as Anthony G. "Cholly Rock" Horne, "Buddha Stretch" Emilio Austin Jr., "Float Master John," Kim D. Holmes, and others who were instrumental in developing and innovating hip-hop dance forms<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup>. The project recognizes that "for Afrodiasporic people, word of mouth is key to passing along artistic and cultural history," and in this way, the oral history documentation methodology aligns with and honors existing cultural traditions of knowledge transmission<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup>. These materials will be made publicly available through the Jerome Robbins Dance Division's reading room and eventually through digital platforms, expanding access beyond the institutional archive.</p>
<p>#### COVID-19 Dance Worker Narratives Project</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, the Dance Oral History Project adapted its mission to immediately document the personal experiences and perspectives of dance artists and workers navigating this unprecedented historical moment<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup>. The project broadly invited all dance artists, teachers, students, and workers in New York City and across the United States to conduct online interviews with their peers for inclusion within the Dance Oral History Project<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. This emergency documentation effort recognized that the pandemic and social justice uprising represented a pivotal moment in dance history that warranted immediate documentation.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 Dance Worker Narratives Project collection documents the unique experiences of dance artists and workers during and after the nationwide pandemic lockdowns and racial justice protests, capturing reflections on creative adaptation, economic hardship, institutional response, artistic resilience, and evolving social consciousness among dance practitioners<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup>. By initiating this documentation during the crisis itself rather than waiting for historical retrospection, the project preserved immediacy, emotional rawness, and contemporary analysis that might otherwise be lost or revised through retrospective interpretation. The materials generated through this project constitute an invaluable historical record of how the dance field experienced and responded to one of the most significant disruptions to live performance in modern history.</p>
<p>#### Irish Dance Legacy Archive</p>
<p>Recognizing gaps in the documentation of Irish dance traditions and the diaspora of Irish dance practitioners across the English-speaking world, the Jerome Robbins Dance Division collaborated with Jean Butler, an acclaimed Irish dance practitioner and contemporary choreographer, and the Our Steps Foundation to create the "Our Steps, Our Stories: An Irish Dance Legacy Archive"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. These oral histories were recorded alongside residencies undertaken by Butler at the Library for the Performing Arts and preserve the stories of Irish dance master practitioners, teachers, and former dancers from across the Irish dance diaspora, including the United States, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. This project extends the division's commitment to documenting dance traditions that may be underrepresented in mainstream American institutional archives while engaging international networks of artists and knowledge holders.</p>
<p>#### AIDS Oral History Documentation</p>
<p>In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a major focus of the Dance Oral History Project were the lives and work of dance professionals at particular risk due to HIV and AIDS<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup>. More than twenty initial interviews were recorded as part of this effort to document the experiences of artists living with and affected by the AIDS epidemic<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. While some of the narrators chose to speak about their HIV status, not all did; the interviews do not constitute a separate collection but are held within the broader archive of dance oral histories<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. This documentation represents a recognition that AIDS profoundly impacted the dance field, particularly among male dancers, choreographers, and other artists, and that preserving the voices and perspectives of those who lived through this tragedy is essential to maintaining an honest historical record<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup>. Moreover, as the project continues to record contemporary oral histories, many narrators now reflect back on the original AIDS years and its ongoing impact on their lives and the field broadly, creating a temporal dialogue across decades.</p>
<h2>Archive Preservation, Digitization, and Modern Accessibility</h2>
<h3>Moving Image Preservation Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division operates sophisticated moving image preservation laboratories equipped to inspect, clean, repair, and reformat a broad range of video and motion picture film formats historically employed by videographers, artists, organizations, and individuals to document and preserve their work and lives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>. The Moving Image Preservation staff work on archival materials contained throughout the New York Public Library system, including materials from the Jerome Robbins Dance Division, Manuscripts and Archives Division, Dorot Jewish Division, Rodgers & Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, Theatre on Film and Tape Archive, and the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These preservation laboratories handle an extraordinary range of video formats spanning from the earliest open-reel video formats from the 1960s and 1970s, such as ½" CV and EIAJ, to the U-matic, Betacam, VHS, and MII analog videocassette formats, through to digital videotape and file-based formats of recent years<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>. The Motion Picture Film preservation staff support the assessment, repair, and care of motion picture film materials across multiple gauges, including Regular 8mm, Super 8mm, Single 8mm, 16mm, and 35mm<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>. Many of these materials are unique film elements ranging from home movies to choreographic and artistic records. All of these analog media types used to record moving images are now obsolete, and the equipment and expertise necessary to extract content from the media are increasingly difficult to obtain<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The preservation laboratory recognizes that most of these analog formats also suffer from various forms of deterioration, such as shrinkage of older acetate-based motion picture film or binder hydrolysis of magnetic tape, which can impede the reformatting process<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>. In response, library engineers generate very high-quality digital files from analog originals in order to avoid having to re-transfer any materials in the future<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>. All reformatting is done using carefully maintained, professional-grade equipment following best practices informed by organizations in the field, including PrestoCentre and the Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA), and by peer institutions such as the Library of Congress and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Major Digitization Initiative and Online Access</h3>
<p>In a transformative initiative, the New York Public Library announced the digitization of over one thousand videos and recordings from the Jerome Robbins Dance Division's Archive of the Recorded Moving Image, now managed through NYPL's Digital Collections and accessible online<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. This digitization initiative, funded by a grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, created a video interface for Digital Collections specifically designed to address the distinctive needs of the dance research community<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. The new online portal serves as a novel delivery system for the library's digitized dance videos, dramatically expanding and enhancing public access to these materials in ways that were previously impossible<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image contains over 24,000 dance films and tapes, representing one of the most substantial collections of recorded dance materials anywhere in the world<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup>. The selection of holdings now available through the new online portal includes items spanning the history of the genre, from the earliest films of the late nineteenth century—such as Thomas Edison's hand-colored 1897 film "Annabella"—to the latest high-definition recordings of modern artists and contemporary productions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. Additional videos are being shared online as they become available, reflecting an ongoing commitment to digitization and public access.</p>
<p>The digitization initiative dramatically improved access both at the Library for the Performing Arts and off-site, making it far easier to find and use audio and moving image collections from the Dance Division regardless of geographic location<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. Prior to this digitization, visitors to the Library for the Performing Arts had to search and request films and videos that were then manually retrieved and delivered by wire cables to a monitor. The new web platform transformed this experience, allowing researchers to search and watch recordings from the Dance Division's holdings on a computer within the facility<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. Most significantly, this project marked the first time any videos from the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image's holdings could be viewed outside the Library for the Performing Arts, fundamentally democratizing access to these irreplaceable materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Innovative Research Tools and Juxtaposition Capability</h3>
<p>Beyond simply creating access to digital materials, NYPL Labs, the library's digital innovation unit, developed innovative tools and capabilities for the Digital Collections website that transform how videos can be watched and used throughout the library's collections<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. The new web tool gives users the ability to combine videos from multiple sources—initially NYPL's Digital Collections and YouTube—into the same workspace, and allows users to edit, annotate, and share their own "mashup" of multimedia content<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. This juxtaposition tool enables researchers to easily compare two performances of the same piece or watch a single production from multiple camera angles<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Using the juxtaposition tool, researchers can create comparative analyses of choreographic works across different eras, different companies, and different interpretations of the same choreography<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. For instance, researchers can simultaneously view recordings of the same ballet performed by American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet, or watch the same contemporary dance work from multiple camera angles filmed during a live performance<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. NYPL Labs released all of the code for this multi-source video player and research space under an open-source license, making the technology available to other software developers, libraries, and institutions to use and help improve<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Specific Notable Digital Collections and Materials</h3>
<p>Among the materials now publicly available from the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image are recordings of diverse dance artists and companies documenting contemporary and historical work<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. Recently acquired collections, delivered as digital files for the first time, include materials from the Mikhail Baryshnikov Archive, Ronald K. Brown Video Archive, and Merce Cunningham Archive<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. More than 60 films from the collection of Victor Jessen have been digitized, including performances by Alexandra Danilova in "Coppélia" with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, and George Balanchine's New York City Ballet productions including "Serenade," "Symphony in C," and "La Valse"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. Additionally, 162 original recordings made by the Dance Division of New York City Ballet's "Balanchine Celebration" performances from 1993 have been digitized and made available, along with 78 recordings from the company's "Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets" from 1990<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The library has also digitized over 300 hours of video from a three-year collaborative project between the Dance Division and Core of Culture to record and preserve disappearing dance traditions from the Kingdom of Bhutan<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>. This collection represents a significant commitment to documenting and preserving endangered dance traditions from outside the Western dance canon, reflecting the division's expanding international scope. Interviews with major dance figures including Julie Kent, Alastair Macaulay, Kevin McKenzie, Ethan Stiefel, and Wendy Whelan, recorded as part of the "Speaking of Dancing" project to document oral histories funded by the Anne Hendricks Bass Foundation, are also now available<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Contemporary Leadership, Operations, and Educational Mission</h2>
<h3>Current Curatorial Leadership</h3>
<p>Linda Murray currently serves as the fifth curator in the history of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division and manages all aspects of its collections and public service<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup>. Murray has previously worked with dance collections at the Library of Congress, where she was trained as a dance specialist, and ran a multidisciplinary arts organization in Washington, DC for seven years<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a></sup>. Her scholarly interests include twentieth-century ballet and gender in performance, though she remains available for general consultations across the entire dance field<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a></sup>. Murray holds an undergraduate degree in French and Russian from Trinity College Dublin and postgraduate degrees in performance and library science from University College Cork and Clarion University, respectively, including specialized archival training<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a></sup>. Her appointment represents a continuation of the division's intellectual leadership and commitment to sophisticated dance scholarship.</p>
<p>Under Murray's tenure, the division has undertaken significant initiatives including celebrating the division's 75th anniversary through innovative site-specific performances throughout the archive itself, recognizing the institutional achievement while honoring the visionary work of founding curator Genevieve Oswald<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-17" id="cite-17">17</a></sup>. Murray's approach emphasizes active engagement with the collections through live performance, public programming, and innovative scholarship, transforming the division from a purely archival repository into what might be described as "a house of dance"—a fully animated and activated space where history comes alive through movement and artistic practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-17" id="cite-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Access Protocols and Visiting the Collection</h3>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division offers walk-in access to general research collections, including audio and moving image materials, on the third floor of the Library for the Performing Arts<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup>. Most materials, including moving image and audio recordings, are available to researchers on a daily, first-come, first-served basis without requiring an appointment, though appointments are encouraged for special collections material<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup>. Patrons may access archival collections within the Library for the Performing Arts by emailing dance@nypl.org or booking a virtual consultation with one of the division's librarians, who will make an appointment for a visit<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Borrowing material from the library requires a valid New York Public Library card, and patrons who want to access archival materials also need to sign up for a Special Collections account<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup>. A limited number of same-day walk-in appointments may be available for special collections material, reflecting the institutional commitment to access combined with the need to manage the handling of fragile historical materials<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup>. The circulating collection on the first and second floors includes an extensive array of books, encyclopedias, periodicals, and commercial DVDs, all available free to check out with a library card<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Educational Programming and Outreach</h3>
<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division has developed a comprehensive educational mission designed to create active learning experiences that complement technique-based curriculum taught in studio and classroom settings<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a></sup>. The division presents materials from its collections to frame dance practice in historical context through multiple educational initiatives. These include virtual lessons conducted by division staff, in-person class visits designed to complement classroom or studio learning, guided tours of the building, research assistance and catalog instruction to help students access the archive on their own, dance exhibit tours with an emphasis on inquiry-based learning, and customized curriculum guides<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a>,<a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>. For educators seeking to bring their students to the division, the institution provides a visit request form process and direct consultation with the division's Education Coordinator to ensure that programming meets specific classroom or organizational needs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Dance Research Fellowship Program</h3>
<p>Since 2015, the Jerome Robbins Dance Division has run a Dance Research Fellowship program welcoming dancers, choreographers, artists, and scholars to focus on a particular topic using the library's archives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-56" id="cite-56">56</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-58" id="cite-58">58</a>,<a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup>. The fellowship recipients each receive a ten-thousand-dollar stipend, dedicated support from a dance librarian as they work in the archive over a six-month research period, and an opportunity to present their research projects at the annual Dance Symposium, a cornerstone event in the New York dance world<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-56" id="cite-56">56</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-58" id="cite-58">58</a>,<a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup>. The research period typically runs from July 1 through December 31 of a given year, culminating with presentations at the January symposium<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-56" id="cite-56">56</a>,<a href="#ref-58" id="cite-58">58</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent fellowship cohorts have focused on major figures and institutions in dance history. In 2024-25, the fellowship program focused on Mikhail Baryshnikov and his archive on the 50th anniversary of his arrival in the United States, with six fellows—Marina Harss, Jordan Demetrius Lloyd, Alessandra Nicifero, Marcelline Mandeng Nken, Brian Seibert, and Maria Vinogradova—exploring diverse aspects of Baryshnikov's career and influence<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-56" id="cite-56">56</a>,<a href="#ref-58" id="cite-58">58</a></sup>. In the previous year, the fellowship focuse</p>
