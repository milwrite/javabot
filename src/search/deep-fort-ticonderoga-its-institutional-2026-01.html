        <h1>Fort Ticonderoga: Institutional Legacy, Collections, Educational Mission, and the Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowship</h1>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga stands as one of North America's most significant historical institutions, dedicated to preserving and interpreting the complex military heritage of the long 18th century spanning 1609 to 1815. Founded in 1909 as a museum and research center, the institution has evolved into a multifaceted cultural destination that houses over 200,000 artifacts related to military culture and material life during one of the most transformative periods in world history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup> The museum's comprehensive mission encompasses preservation of the physical fort itself, stewardship of an expansive collection that documents British, European, Native Nations, and African stories of this era, and active educational engagement with K-12 schools across all fifty states and beyond.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a>,<a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup> The Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowship program represents a contemporary manifestation of the institution's commitment to scholarly research and emerging professional development in museum studies, archaeology, and historical education, offering four annual fellowships that provide hands-on internship experience within this premier historic site.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup></p>
<h2>Institutional History and the Vision of Stephen and Sarah Pell</h2>
<p>The founding of Fort Ticonderoga as a museum represents a remarkable private initiative to preserve American military heritage during the early twentieth century. Stephen Hyatt Pell, a visionary preservationist whose family had owned the property since 1820 when they purchased it as a summer retreat, spearheaded the transformation of what had become a deteriorating ruin into a world-class cultural institution.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup> The Pell family's initial acquisition of the property was motivated by the value of the strategic location and the growing tourist traffic to the region facilitated by expanding railroad and canal connections to New York City.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> However, it was Stephen Pell's recognition of the site's historical significance that catalyzed the comprehensive restoration effort beginning in 1908 and continuing through 1909, which transformed the crumbling fort into a functioning museum accessible to the public.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The architectural restoration of the fort was undertaken with meticulous attention to historical detail under the direction of English architect Alfred Bossom, who worked in consultation with Stephen Pell to recreate the fort's structures based on historical records and physical evidence.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> The inaugural ceremonies opening the museum to the public in 1909 commemorated the three-hundredth anniversary of Samuel de Champlain's discovery of Lake Champlain by European explorers and were attended by President William Howard Taft, establishing the institution immediately as a site of national significance.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> This early commitment to public education and democratic access to history established a precedent that continues to define the institution's mission more than a century later. The restoration project itself uncovered thousands of artifacts tightly bounded by the occupation of the site between 1755 and 1781, artifacts that became the foundation for the museum's future collections development.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond Stephen Pell's architectural and curatorial vision, his wife Sarah Gibbs Thompson Pell emerged as a crucial figure in the institution's development and broader historical significance. Sarah Pell, born in 1878 and raised to view public service as both a birthright and an obligation, devoted her considerable wealth and personal networks to advancing both historic preservation and women's rights.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> Described as a "charmingly aggressive woman" by her contemporaries, Sarah became active in the women's suffrage movement in 1913 and joined Alice Paul in the newly formed National Woman's Party in 1918, demonstrating how the work of historic preservation could be intertwined with progressive political activism.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> Sarah believed profoundly that without preserving the past and building upon the work of previous generations, society could never achieve the ideals of liberty and justice for all, a philosophy that she articulated eloquently during a CBS radio address in 1936.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> Her commitment to Fort Ticonderoga's preservation was integral to the institution's early development, and her legacy now includes recognition through exhibitions devoted to her life and equal rights activism, with her turn-of-the-twentieth-century silk shoes with glass bead decoration now cataloged as part of the museum's collections and destined for display in an upcoming exhibit dedicated to her transformative role.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Stephen Pell's institutional innovations extended beyond restoration and collection-building to include the formal establishment of the Fort Ticonderoga Association in 1931, the organization that continues to govern the institution today and that brought enhanced organizational stability and long-term planning capacity to the endeavor.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup> Funding for the extensive restoration and ongoing operations came from diverse sources including Robert M. Thompson, father of Stephen Pell's wife Sarah Gibbs Thompson, whose financial contributions enabled both the restoration work and the early years of museum operation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> This partnership of capital, vision, and historical commitment created a sustainable institutional framework that transformed a private summer retreat into a public cultural institution of enduring importance.</p>
<h2>Historical Significance and Military Heritage of the Fort</h2>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga, originally constructed as Fort Carillon by the French between October 1755 and 1757, occupies a location of profound strategic importance in North American military history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The fort was constructed at the narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain in northern New York by French-Canadian military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière, during the French and Indian War, sometimes known overseas as the "North American theater" of the Seven Years' War.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The strategic positioning of the fort at the confluence of Lake Champlain and Lake George, controlling the approximately 3.5-mile portage alongside the rapids-infested La Chute River, made it economically and militarily crucial for controlling the trade routes and communication lines between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley to the south and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley to the north.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>The fort's distinctive star shape, with diamond-shaped projections called bastions at each corner, derived from the renowned military engineering principles of Vauban and represented the cutting-edge fortification technology designed to resist artillery, which was the most powerful weapon system of its era.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> This architectural design allowed virtually every part of the fort's walls to be covered by crossfire from other parts of the fortification, ensuring maximum defensive capacity—a form of military architecture that became emblematic of European imperial expansion across the globe during the eighteenth century.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> The name "Carillon" itself derives from either the sounds made by the rapids of La Chute River, which were said to resemble the chiming bells of a carillon, or possibly from French officer Philippe de Carrion du Fresnoy, who may have established a trading post at the site in the late seventeenth century, though the exact etymology remains contested among historians.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The fort's initial significance emerged from its role as a launching point for French military operations in the French and Indian War. In August 1757, French forces captured Fort William Henry in an action launched from Fort Carillon, and this and a string of other French victories that year prompted the British to organize a large-scale attack on the fort as part of a comprehensive military strategy against French Canada.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The most famous engagement at the site occurred during the Battle of Carillon on July 8, 1758, when approximately 4,000 French defenders, under the command of the Marquis de Montcalm, astonishingly repelled an attack by approximately 16,000 British troops under General James Abercromby.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup> This battle gave the fort a reputation for apparent impregnability that would profoundly influence future military thinking and tactics in the region, notably during the American Revolutionary War, when the small garrison would ultimately be captured without a pitched battle.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The battle was one of the largest of the French and Indian War and the bloodiest battle fought in North America until the Civil War, a distinction that underscores the intensity of conflict at this strategic location.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the French victory at the Battle of Carillon, General Montcalm anticipated further British attacks and ordered additional defensive works, including the construction of the Germain and Pontleroy redoubts to the northeast of the fort, named for the military engineers under whose direction they were constructed.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> However, the British did not renew their assault in 1758, and the French subsequently withdrew most of the garrison in November for the winter to defend Quebec City, Montreal, and French-controlled forts on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> The British under General Jeffery Amherst finally captured the fort in the 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga, a much less dramatic encounter in which 11,000 British troops using emplaced artillery drove off a token garrison of 400 Frenchmen.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> During this action, the French commander Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'Hébécourt ordered the destruction of the fort's powder magazine through an explosives charge that killed five and wounded thirty-one of the besieging British soldiers, though the main walls were not severely damaged.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> The British then renamed the captured fortification Fort Ticonderoga and embarked on a series of improvements to the area and construction of a fleet to conduct military operations on Lake Champlain.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The strategic importance of Fort Ticonderoga in controlling Lake Champlain made the location critical during the American Revolutionary War, when the fort's possession determined military advantage in the Northern Department of the Continental Army. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the battles of Lexington and Concord ignited the American Revolutionary War, a small American force surprised the British garrison of approximately 48 soldiers stationed at the then-deteriorating and undermanned fort.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The capture was executed through a joint operation commanded by Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys militia, who coordinated with Benedict Arnold, who held a commission from Massachusetts, in a swift late-night sneak attack across Lake Champlain from Vermont.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> This engagement represented the first American offensive victory of the Revolutionary War and proved strategically significant not primarily for the fort itself, but rather for the vast artillery cache it contained—cannons that Henry Knox would transport to Boston during the winter of 1775-1776, a feat of military logistics that became known as the "Noble Train of Artillery."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Fort's Strategic Role in the Revolutionary War and Subsequent History</h2>
<p>The significance of Fort Ticonderoga's artillery to American Revolutionary prospects cannot be overstated. George Washington, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, commissioned Colonel Henry Knox to undertake the ambitious task of gathering the heavy guns captured at Ticonderoga and transporting them to Boston, where they were desperately needed to break the British siege of the city.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Knox organized the transfer of fifty-nine pieces of artillery over frozen rivers and the snow-covered Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts in a grueling winter journey spanning over three hundred miles, a feat that Knox accomplished through meticulous planning and the strategic use of oxen and draft horses to haul the heavy guns across treacherous terrain.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> When mounted on Dorchester Heights overlooking Boston, the guns from Ticonderoga proved decisive in compelling the British to evacuate the city in March 1776, achieving a major American strategic victory without the loss of life that would have accompanied a traditional siege assault.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The American forces dramatically re-fortified Fort Ticonderoga and its surrounding areas in 1776, adding miles of fortifications around the site to strengthen its defensive capacity and secure the vital supply line to Canada and the American Army maintaining siege operations at Quebec City.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> The British failed to retake the fort during their 1776 campaigns but returned with overwhelming force under General John Burgoyne in 1777 during the Saratoga Campaign to launch a new assault from the north.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> Burgoyne's engineers captured the unoccupied high ground of nearby Mount Defiance and hauled cannons to its summit, aiming them at the American garrison of Fort Ticonderoga.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> Recognizing their untenable position under artillery bombardment from superior ground, the American garrison abandoned the fort without fighting on July 5, 1777, evacuating to prevent encirclement and capture.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> After Burgoyne's decisive defeat at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, the fort no longer played a major strategic role in the Revolutionary War, as the theater of British military operations shifted southward and the war's center of gravity moved to other regions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War in 1783, Fort Ticonderoga ceased to hold significant military value for the United States, and the fort was allowed to fall into substantial ruin as local residents stripped it of much of its usable building materials.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> The site was purchased by the Pell family in 1820 and developed as a private summer retreat as the expanding railroad and canal networks increasingly brought tourists to the Lake Champlain region.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> It was the recognition of the site's historical importance and architectural significance by Stephen Pell that catalyzed the comprehensive restoration beginning in 1908 and the establishment of the museum in 1909 that continues to operate the fort as a historic site, museum, and research center to the present day.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The fort received formal recognition of its significance when it was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of Interior.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> However, the fort has faced ongoing preservation challenges, particularly regarding the condition of its walls and the nineteenth-century pavilion constructed by William Ferris Pell, and the fort has been on a watchlist of National Historic Landmarks since 1998 due to deterioration concerns.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> Notable restoration work has included the reconstruction in 2008 by Tonetti Associates Architects of the powder magazine that had been destroyed by the French in 1759, with the reconstruction based in part on the original 1755 plans.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> These ongoing preservation efforts reflect the institution's commitment to maintaining this internationally significant military structure for future generations.</p>
<h2>Mission, Values, and Educational Philosophy</h2>
<p>The mission of Fort Ticonderoga articulates a comprehensive approach to historical preservation and public engagement that extends far beyond traditional museum curation. As stated by the institution, the mission is "to preserve, educate and provoke active discussion about the past and its importance to present and future generations."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup> This formulation reflects an understanding that historical preservation serves not merely nostalgic or antiquarian purposes, but rather constitutes a vital civic function of enabling citizens to learn from the past and apply those lessons to contemporary challenges. The emphasis on "provoking active discussion" distinguishes Fort Ticonderoga's mission from passive commemoration, instead positioning the institution as an active agent in facilitating critical engagement with complex historical narratives and their contemporary implications.</p>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga's collections encompass British, European, Native Nations, and African stories that demonstrate the complexities of a shared Atlantic history, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of how military history intersects with broader patterns of colonization, displacement, trade, and cultural interaction.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup> Rather than presenting military history as the isolated deeds of generals and battles, the institution's collections-based approach encompasses the experiences of soldiers and civilians, men and women, the powerful and the subordinated, thereby revealing how military conflicts shaped and were shaped by broader social, economic, and cultural forces.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-54" id="cite-54">54</a></sup> This multivalent approach to military history recognizes that understanding Fort Ticonderoga requires attention to French, British, German, American, and Native American perspectives, and that the fort's history cannot be understood apart from the Indigenous peoples who inhabited the region for centuries before European arrival.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-10" id="cite-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>The educational philosophy guiding Fort Ticonderoga's programs reflects a commitment to making history accessible to diverse learners through multisensory engagement, hands-on interaction, and primary source analysis. The institution serves thousands of educators and affiliate K-12 schools in all fifty states and beyond, functioning as a national resource for history education and professional development.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a></sup> This commitment to national reach emerges from the conviction that the founding era and the military conflicts that shaped it constitute vital touchstones for American civic identity and contemporary governance, and that these historical lessons remain relevant across geographic regions and diverse student populations. Fort Ticonderoga's educational outreach demonstrates recognition that historical understanding develops most effectively when learners can engage directly with material evidence, handle reproductions of period equipment, and grapple with primary source documents that reveal the perspectives and experiences of historical actors.</p>
<h2>Collections, Artifacts, and Archaeological Discoveries</h2>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga maintains what is arguably North America's most comprehensive collection of material culture related to eighteenth-century military life, encompassing approximately 200,000 artifacts that represent the material remains of one of the most consequential periods in world history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-56" id="cite-56">56</a></sup> The collections range from spectacular pieces such as complete artillery pieces and full suits of military uniform to intimate domestic objects like pins, needles, pipes, and ceramic fragments that illuminate daily life within the fort and the camps surrounding it.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> The comprehensiveness of the collection emerged from multiple sources of acquisition, including artifacts recovered during the early twentieth-century restoration of the fort between 1908 and 1909, objects purchased on the market by acquisitive curators seeking to expand the collection, and more recent systematic archaeological excavations conducted on both the land and in the waters of Lake Champlain surrounding the site.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>The archaeological collections represent a particularly rich dimension of Fort Ticonderoga's holdings, offering windows into occupation patterns spanning from 1755 to 1781 and beyond. Restoration efforts in the early twentieth century uncovered thousands of artifacts tightly bounded by the occupation of the site during this critical military period, objects that were initially stored in relatively informal fashion before subsequent restoration and systematic cataloging efforts transformed them into a coherent research resource.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Formal archaeological excavations expanded significantly through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including underwater archaeology conducted in the 1980s and 2019 investigating the King's Shipyard where the British constructed vessels such as the sloop Boscawen and the brigantine Duke of Cumberland to maintain naval superiority on Lake Champlain.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> More recent archaeological investigations have encompassed excavations conducted in the early 2000s during construction of the Mars Education Center, which yielded substantial numbers of additional artifacts now in the process of systematic cataloging and housing by the Collections Department.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the most significant collections at Fort Ticonderoga are specialized assemblages representing particular dimensions of eighteenth-century material culture. The Collections Department has identified the largest assemblage of eighteenth-century tools in North America as part of the museum's holdings, artifacts including shovels, axes, mattocks, picks, augers, fascine knives, Irish spades or loys, as well as masonry, woodworking, and agricultural tools.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> Many of these tools bear maker's marks and retain remnant pieces of wooden handles, providing invaluable information about manufacturing practices, tool use, and the material infrastructure supporting military operations at the fort.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> The Collections Department has cataloged over 1,300 tools through dedicated cataloging projects, with ongoing work including conservation assessment conducted in partnership with the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum with plans for future conservation and exhibition of these significant holdings.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Equally impressive is the museum's ammunition collection, which encompasses thousands of projectiles from all periods of occupation including cannon balls ranging in weight from one pound to thirty-two pounds, the latter representing the largest cannon known to have been used at the site.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> The collection includes over eight thousand musket balls individually measured and cataloged, with unique examples retaining distinctive markings such as ram rod impressions or indentations indicating canister shots that provide information about ammunition manufacturing and deployment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> Thousands of pieces of grapeshot weighing from one and one-half ounces to one pound have been documented, revealing the most extensive casting marks and manufacturing flaws of all ammunition types in the collection, providing material evidence of rapid production during periods of intense military activity.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Archaeological excavations have also yielded abundant domestic and military objects including copper kettles, tin canteens, and bayonets that speak to the daily lives and material practices of soldiers and civilians at the fort.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Among the bulk of iron objects and fragments, catalogers have identified thin rectangular pieces ranging from three to five inches in length with large squared ends and teethed protrusions that have been identified as historical door bolts, artifacts that illustrate how rigorous conservation work and meticulous documentation transform seemingly unremarkable fragments into comprehensible historical evidence.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> Textile fragments and ceramics provide crucial information about foodways, trade networks, and the daily routines of soldiers and the women and children who accompanied military units to the fort.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Rare artifacts such as a yellow silk petticoat dated 1746 with red linsey-woolsey interior and embroidered English Coat of Arms, now housed in custom blueboard boxes to prevent unnecessary folds in the fabric, reveal the presence of women of some social standing within the fort and the complex social hierarchies that persisted even in military contexts.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> More recently cataloged artifacts including turn-of-the-twentieth-century J & J Slater heeled silk shoes with glass bead decoration on the toe caps, once owned by Sarah G. T. Pell, the institution's co-founder, connect the museum's collecting practice to its own institutional history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The scope and significance of Fort Ticonderoga's collections have attracted recognition from major funding agencies and scholars nationally and internationally. The institution maintains one of the richest collections of material related to warfare in northeastern North America in the second half of the eighteenth century, encompassing the largest collection of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century military uniforms in North America, a comprehensive collection of early modern weaponry spanning the long eighteenth century, and the largest collection of eighteenth-century artillery in the western hemisphere.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup> The museum also houses one of the largest collections of eighteenth-century military archaeology in the country and a significant archive of eighteenth-century manuscripts related to the Northern campaigns of the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, including loose documents such as letters, receipts, returns, muster rolls, and memoranda as well as bound diaries, journals, orderly and account books that shed light on the daily experiences of soldiers and civilians from France, Great Britain, the United States, and Canada.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-51" id="cite-51">51</a>,<a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup> These manuscript collections constitute an invaluable primary source base for scholarly research on the military, social, economic, and cultural history of this transformative era.</p>
<h2>Educational Programs and Classroom Outreach</h2>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga has developed an innovative and comprehensive system of educational programs designed to bring history to life for students and educators across the United States. The institution's classroom outreach programs inspire students as they explore the founding of the United States, from Americans' service in colonial wars through the Revolutionary War, utilizing reproduction clothing and equipment carefully reproduced from the Fort Ticonderoga Museum Collection to illustrate the events, famous figures, and everyday people who shaped history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> The educational approach emphasizes multisensory engagement and hands-on exploration, recognizing that learning progresses most effectively when students can visualize, handle, and manipulate physical objects and reproductions that connect abstract historical knowledge to concrete material reality.</p>
<p>The educational offerings span multiple grade levels and address diverse learning objectives through carefully designed programs that integrate history with other academic disciplines. The "A Soldier's Life" program, a forty-five-minute engaging exploration of daily life for American soldiers during the Revolutionary War, enables students to examine reproduction clothing and equipment while exploring the diet of soldiers and discussing the challenges of transportation and supplying the Continental Army, thereby incorporating history, geography, and mathematics to provide context to Ticonderoga's strategic location.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> The "Henry Knox in the Classroom" program invites students to imagine the scale of Henry Knox's logistical feat of transporting heavy artillery from Ticonderoga to the siege of Boston through engagement with non-firing reproduction cannon, oxen yokes, draft horse collars, and other material evidence.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This forty-five-minute program utilizes real primary sources to enable students to engage in historians' detective work to understand the "Noble Train of Artillery" phenomenon, connecting military logistics to the discipline of historical research.</p>
<p>Programming addressing the French and Indian War and earlier colonial conflicts provides additional learning opportunities for students studying pre-Revolutionary conflict. The "A Provincial Soldier's Life" program, a forty-five-minute engagement with carefully reproduced clothing, equipment, and commodities central to daily life for provincial soldiers in colonial America, incorporates history and geography to connect colonial trade to the daily experience of American Provincial soldiers on campaign during the French and Indian War.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This program enables students to explore the connections between colonial military service, global networks of trade, and imperial competition for resources, facilitating understanding of how military conflicts emerge from and reflect broader economic and political structures.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>The maritime dimension of Fort Ticonderoga's history receives attention through the "Maritime Artificer's Apprentice" program, an interdisciplinary forty-five-minute offering that incorporates history, science, geography, and mathematics to discuss Ticonderoga's Revolutionary War naval history on Lake Champlain and its role in the founding of the nation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Students engage with the story of the American fleet on Lake Champlain in 1776 by examining maritime trades of sail making, rigging, and naval carpentry to consider the importance of naval transport in supplying and defending a new nation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This program recognizes that Revolutionary War history cannot be understood apart from naval operations and that mastery of maritime technology was essential to military and economic success during this period.</p>
<p>For more advanced learners, the "Questioning History" program provides guided inquiry into Revolutionary War documents enabling middle and high school students to think critically about interpreting primary sources and unpacking the vocabulary and context of Revolutionary War documents.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This fifty-minute discussion with museum historians enables exploration of the Revolutionary War while connecting geography, archaeology, and art through the Fort Ticonderoga Museum Collection.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Students can explore further with transcribed selections of documents addressing topics including medicine, combat and tactics, supply, women and civilians, and the militia, thereby developing research skills and understanding how historical knowledge is constructed through engagement with primary evidence.</p>
<p>Beyond classroom outreach programs delivered to visiting student groups, Fort Ticonderoga has expanded its educational reach through comprehensive living history programming and virtual learning opportunities. The institution's signature REAL TIME REVOLUTION® program, hailed as the premier living history program in North America, brings history to life through innovative storytelling on a grand scale, historic trades demonstrations, daily soldiers' life programs, and thrilling weapons demonstrations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> These programs operate seasonally from May through October and include daily musket firing demonstrations exploring the workings of diverse firearms, cannon firing demonstrations examining how artillery transcended British and American armies, soldiers' dinner experiences exploring military provisioning, shoemaking demonstrations investigating the construction of soldiers' shoes, tailoring programs examining uniforms and military dress, artillery artificers programs within the Powder Magazine, maritime trades demonstrations within the maritime boathouse, livestock demonstrations featuring heritage breed oxen, fifes and drums performances, and gardening programs exploring the King's Garden.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The institution has also invested in digital education initiatives extending its reach beyond geographic limitations. Fort Ticonderoga has made more than four hundred virtual seats available for special events, offering affordable opportunities to experience history at home and enabling educators and students unable to visit the physical site to participate in educational programming.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a></sup> These virtual learning opportunities reflect recognition that geography should not limit access to historical education and that digital technology enables the institution to fulfill its national mission to serve educators across all fifty states.</p>
<h2>The Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowship Program</h2>
<p>The Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowship represents a contemporary institutional commitment to developing the next generation of museum professionals, historians, and archaeologists through structured internship experiences combining hands-on learning with scholarly engagement at a premier historic site. The fellowship program is named in honor of the Pell family whose vision, resources, and stewardship established and sustained Fort Ticonderoga as a public institution, and the program embodies the institution's belief that emerging scholars and professionals benefit immensely from intensive mentorship within functioning cultural institutions engaged in meaningful preservation, research, and educational work.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Each year, Fort Ticonderoga offers four graduate fellowships available to both graduate and undergraduate students seeking practical, hands-on internship experience at a historic site and museum engaged in sophisticated collections management, archaeological research, and educational programming.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> The program operates during the summer season from June 8 through August 14, providing approximately ten weeks of intensive engagement with the institution's staff and work. Applicants for the 2026 fellowships had an application deadline of January 19, 2026, with the fellowship position offering a $3,000 stipend plus shared on-site staff housing, thereby removing financial barriers to participation that might otherwise prevent emerging scholars from participating in professional development opportunities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>The fellowship offerings address multiple dimensions of the institution's operations and mission. The Archaeological Collections Fellowship, one of the four available positions, focuses on cataloging, photographing, and rehousing archaeological collections excavated in the early 2000s during construction of the Mars Education Center, contributing to the ongoing systematic documentation and preservation of the institution's collections.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> The Archaeological Collections fellow works directly with the Collections Department to catalog artifacts, take record images of each artifact or group of artifacts, rehouse collections as necessary, create social media posts about the project, and work on other collections departmental initiatives as assigned.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> This position requires a Bachelor's degree in History, Art History, Museum Studies, Material Culture, Archaeology, or demonstrated collections or archaeological experience, and the fellow must possess practical knowledge of object handling and research, previous experience working with collections management databases, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets, with demonstrated proficiency in digital photography considered a significant asset.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>A second fellowship position focuses on educational programming and outreach. The Education Fellowship enables emerging educators to work alongside Fort Ticonderoga's experienced interpretive staff to develop and deliver educational programs reaching diverse audiences from schoolchildren to adult learners.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup> This position provides practical experience in program development, public speaking, historical interpretation, and audience engagement, equipping fellows with experience that prepares them for careers in museum education, historic site interpretation, or academic teaching. The Education Fellowship recognizes that public history education represents a distinct professional discipline requiring specific skill sets and knowledge bases that benefit from mentorship within functioning cultural institutions.</p>
<p>Additional fellowship positions address specialized dimensions of the institution's work. The institution also offers specialized fellowships in archaeology and other areas of scholarly research and institutional function, demonstrating commitment to supporting emerging professionals across the range of disciplines and skill sets necessary to operate a comprehensive historic site and museum.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup> These fellowships provide genuine professional development experiences rather than exploitative free labor arrangements, with fellows receiving meaningful stipends and housing that enable their participation regardless of family financial resources.</p>
<p>The Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowship program has produced cohorts of early-career professionals who have gone on to significant careers in museum studies, public history, archaeology, and historical research. Fellows have engaged in specialized research addressing topics including the experience of slavery and conflict on the Ohio Frontier during the American Revolution, the role of German soldiers in the Revolutionary War, and other dimensions of military history and social experience during the long eighteenth century.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> These research projects often result in publications, conference presentations, and exhibitions that share the fellows' discoveries and interpretations with scholarly communities and the broader public, thereby multiplying the impact of the fellowship program beyond the immediate participants to shape public understanding of this critical historical period.</p>
<p>The fellowship program also addresses practical workforce development needs within cultural institutions. The museum field faces ongoing challenges in developing diverse and capable workforces, and the Edward W. Pell Graduate Fellowships contribute to building the professional capacity of the museum, historic site, and public history fields more broadly.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup> By providing structured mentorship, meaningful work experience, and stipended support, the fellowship program helps emerging professionals navigate the often-challenging transition from academic training to professional practice, equipping them with experience, networks, and credentials that enhance their competitiveness in professional employment markets.</p>
<h2>Preservation Initiatives and Future Directions</h2>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga has undertaken significant preservation investments reflecting institutional commitment to stewarding the historic structures, archaeological landscape, and collections for present and future generations. The institution has announced several important preservation projects totaling more than two million dollars, demonstrating substantial investment in the physical infrastructure and materials that constitute the historic site.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-42" id="cite-42">42</a></sup> These projects address both the protection of the fort's historic walls and structures and the development of improved facilities for collections storage, display, and scholarly access. The comprehensive nature of these preservation initiatives reflects recognition that historical stewardship requires ongoing investment in physical maintenance, collections management, and research infrastructure rather than representing a one-time restoration effort.</p>
<p>The institution's efforts to develop a Master Building, Preservation, and Storage Needs Plan received significant support from the National Endowment for the Humanities Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections grant program, which provided funds to assemble an interdisciplinary collaborative team to assess preservation needs and develop comprehensive recommendations for addressing the vulnerabilities and risks affecting the museum's collections and historic structures.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup> This planning effort recognizes that effective preservation requires balancing the diverse needs of stored collections with the performance capacity of the historic building envelope, utilizing both passive and active measures to mitigate risks to collections while emphasizing achievable targets for collections environments and solutions that are energy and cost efficient.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup> The plan includes recommendations concerning storage needs for a new three-thousand-object collection that the museum acquired and moved to the Ticonderoga Preservation & Research Center in 2022, as well as broader architectural improvements and an implementation plan including space plans for collections storage.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-59" id="cite-59">59</a></sup></p>
