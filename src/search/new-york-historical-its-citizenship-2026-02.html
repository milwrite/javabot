        <h1>The New York Historical Society's Citizenship Project: An In-Depth Analysis of Primary Objects and Their Role in Immigrant Civic Education</h1>
<p>The New York Historical Society's Citizenship Project represents a innovative approach to preparing legal permanent residents for United States naturalization by leveraging authentic historical artifacts and documents as primary teaching tools rather than relying on traditional textbook-based instruction.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> Since its launch in the summer of 2017, this museum-based civic education initiative has served over ten thousand green card holders, transforming how immigrants understand and engage with American history and civics.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> The program's distinctive methodology employs object-based inquiry to teach the one hundred questions required by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) naturalization examination, using carefully selected artifacts, paintings, manuscripts, and other primary sources from the New York Historical Society's extensive collections spanning more than four centuries.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> Rather than asking students to memorize facts from government handbooks, the Citizenship Project facilitates deeper learning and genuine engagement with American history by examining the tangible objects that embody key historical moments and civic principles.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the primary objects utilized in the program, explores how these artifacts enhance learning outcomes, and examines the broader implications of this innovative educational model for immigrant communities and museums nationwide.</p>
<h2>Origins, Context, and Mission of the Citizenship Project</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project emerged as a direct response to shifting political conversations surrounding immigration policy and the recognition that museums possess unique educational capacities to serve immigrant communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup> President and Chief Executive Officer Louise Mirrer conceived the initiative as a way for the New York Historical Society to fulfill its core institutional mission of teaching American history while simultaneously providing practical, meaningful support to legal permanent residents seeking citizenship.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The program was launched in partnership with the City University of New York's Citizenship Now initiative, combining the museum's extensive collections and educational expertise with CUNY's established networks serving immigrant populations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup> The historical context surrounding the program's creation is significant, as the New York Historical Society began the project after President Trump announced a travel ban on certain visitors at the start of his administration in early 2017, creating a moment when the institution felt compelled to actively support immigrant communities through its primary institutional strengths.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Although leadership at the New York Historical Society maintains that the Citizenship Project is apolitical and rooted in the institution's educational mission rather than political activism, the timing reflects a broader cultural moment in which museums reconsidered their roles as potential advocates for marginalized communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> The program's structure drew upon the New York Historical Society's existing educational programming, which already served more than two hundred thousand K-12 students annually, ensuring that the Citizenship Project could build upon established pedagogical expertise and institutional infrastructure.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The fundamental mission of the Citizenship Project extends beyond simple test preparation. Rather than viewing naturalization as merely a legal procedural requirement, the program's educators and administrators conceptualize citizenship as a deeper intellectual and emotional engagement with American history, civics, and democratic principles.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The curriculum encompasses twelve two-hour lessons covering American history from the colonial era through the Vietnam War, deliberately addressing complex and contested chapters of the national narrative including slavery, westward expansion, Native American removal, and Civil Rights struggles.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> By confronting these difficult histories directly through authentic primary sources and artifacts, the program rejects the notion that citizenship education should sanitize or simplify American history.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Instead, the Citizenship Project argues that meaningful civic participation and genuine citizenship require understanding the nation's full historical complexity, including its failures and injustices.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> This pedagogical philosophy reflects broader conversations within museum education about the responsibility of cultural institutions to present inclusive, multivocal narratives that acknowledge diverse experiences and perspectives within American history.</p>
<h2>Pedagogical Framework and Object-Based Inquiry Methodology</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project's pedagogical approach centers on object-based inquiry, which enables students to discover historical narratives and civics concepts through sustained examination of and conversation about authentic artifacts rather than through lecture-based instruction or textbook reading.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The methodology is particularly effective for non-native English speakers preparing for an orally administered naturalization examination, as it provides multiple pathways to understanding and allows students to practice English language skills in meaningful, conversational contexts.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Rather than distributing flashcards or study guides, Citizenship Educators guide students through the New York Historical Society's galleries, spending ten to fifteen minutes with a single artifact and encouraging learners to observe carefully, share observations, and collectively piece together the historical significance of the object.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This conversational, inquiry-driven approach contrasts sharply with traditional citizenship preparation classes that rely heavily on rote memorization of facts.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The program's educators report that students find visual learning significantly more engaging and memorable than text-based approaches, particularly those students who struggled with English language literacy or had limited exposure to formal American history education as children.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Many Citizenship Project participants immigrated to the United States as adults and therefore never learned American history in school, making the museum's object-based approach especially valuable for filling knowledge gaps while simultaneously building confidence in engaging with cultural institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Educators working with the program have emphasized that visual learning serves multiple simultaneous purposes within the curriculum. First, artifacts provide concrete anchors for abstract civics concepts that can be difficult to explain through language alone, particularly concepts like "rule of law" or "separation of powers" that require significant contextual understanding.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Second, objects serve as memory aids, allowing students to create vivid mental images and associations that enhance retention of specific historical facts required for the civics examination.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Third, and perhaps most importantly, artifacts humanize historical events and figures, transforming distant historical moments into emotionally resonant experiences that help students feel personally connected to American history and invested in their new nation's narrative.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> This approach aligns with broader trends in museum education emphasizing that learning through objects can generate deeper understanding and more meaningful engagement than traditional textbook instruction, particularly for adult learners who bring diverse prior experiences and perspectives to the classroom.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The Citizenship Project demonstrates that museum-based education need not be reserved for leisured tourists or school groups; rather, museums can serve as critical civic infrastructure supporting marginalized communities in achieving life-changing goals such as naturalization.</p>
<h2>The John Rogers Sculpture Collection and the Representation of Slavery</h2>
<p>Among the most pedagogically powerful primary objects utilized in the Citizenship Project are the sculptures created by John Rogers, a nineteenth-century American artist whose work powerfully captured moral and social dimensions of American history. The most frequently referenced Rogers sculpture in Citizenship Project instruction is <em>The Slave Auction</em>, a small plaster work depicting a Black family being torn apart through the mechanics of slavery.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This sculpture presents a family in the moment of auction, with the father standing defiantly with crossed arms, his wife positioned on the opposite side of the auctioneer's rostrum, and her young children clinging to her in fear and desperation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup> The composition's emotional intensity derives from Rogers' deliberate artistic choices: he portrayed the enslaved woman with Caucasian features to suggest her mixed racial heritage and to allude to the sexual abuse of enslaved women by white men in positions of authority.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup> The auctioneer himself is rendered with sinister visual markers, his hair curled to resemble horns and what appears to be a tail visible beneath his coat, signifying Rogers' moral condemnation of the institution of slavery itself.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup> Crucially, the auctioneer holds a sign advertising the sale with shocking casualness: "Great Sale/of/Horses, Cattle/Negroes & Other/Farm Stock/This Day at/Public Auction."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup> This linguistic and visual juxtaposition of human beings with livestock encapsulates the dehumanizing logic of slavery.</p>
<p>Citizenship Project educators employ <em>The Slave Auction</em> as an entry point for discussing the institution of slavery and the Thirteenth Amendment, questions that appear on the USCIS civics examination.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> However, the teaching methodology extends far beyond testing requirements. When students examine the sculpture together, they engage in interpretive conversation about the emotional and physical realities of slavery, discussing how the artist's choices communicate moral judgment and historical truth.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> One student enrolled in a Citizenship Project class articulated the power of this experience directly: "She's scared they are taking her children away from her. They did that to families during slavery."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Through this simple observation, the student connected the sculpture's representation of a moment in time with the broader historical reality of family separation under slavery, demonstrating how object-based learning generates understanding that extends beyond isolated facts to encompass historical meaning and human consequence.</p>
<p>The historical context of Rogers' sculpture adds further educational depth. Rogers created <em>The Slave Auction</em> and offered it for sale in New York in 1859, merely two weeks after the execution of abolitionist John Brown.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup> The timing was extraordinarily fraught, as Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry had intensified sectional tensions between North and South. Despite the sculpture's compelling moral force, Rogers encountered enormous commercial resistance in New York, a city with strong economic ties to the slaveholding South.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup> Store owners refused to display the sculpture publicly, fearing it would offend Southern customers upon whose patronage their businesses depended.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup> Undaunted, Rogers hired a Black man to sell the sculpture on the streets, and eventually the work gained attention within abolitionist circles through advocates like Lewis Tappan, with favorable critical notices appearing in abolitionist publications including the National Anti-Slavery Standard and the New York Daily Tribune.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18" id="cite-18">18</a></sup> This history of the sculpture's reception and circulation teaches crucial lessons about how artistic expression intersects with commercial interests, regional politics, and social movements, lessons that transcend the basic facts tested on the naturalization examination.</p>
<p>For Citizenship Project students, encountering <em>The Slave Auction</em> in the museum context invites reflection on how Americans then and now have grappled with the moral reality of slavery. The sculpture forces engagement with difficult history not as abstract historical narrative but as moral reckoning visible in artistic form. This approach honors the experiences of many Citizenship Project students, who themselves come from nations with complicated histories and understand that national identity requires confronting historical complexity rather than celebrating sanitized narratives of inevitable progress. By teaching American civics through <em>The Slave Auction</em>, educators communicate that citizenship involves understanding one's nation fully, including its darkest chapters, and that commitment to democratic values requires honestly examining how those values have been honored and violated throughout history.</p>
<h2>The Draft Wheel and the Complexity of American Conflict</h2>
<p>Another central artifact employed in Citizenship Project instruction is the Civil War era draft wheel, a physical object that encapsulates a crucial moment of American conflict and social tension.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The draft wheel originated in 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln established the nation's first military conscription system, implemented as Union Army enlistment declined and the Civil War reached a critical phase requiring massive troop mobilization.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The mechanics of the lottery system were straightforward: the government printed names on cards, inserted them into the drum-shaped wheel, and randomly selected individuals for military service.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> What makes the New York Historical Society's draft wheel exceptional is its provenance: it is the only draft wheel known to have survived the Draft Riots of July 1863, violent riots that erupted in New York City when the draft lottery results became known.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The Draft Riots were among the most severe civil disturbances in nineteenth-century American history, driven fundamentally by class and ethnic resentment among working-class New Yorkers, particularly Irish immigrants who perceived the conscription system as unjust because wealthy men could legally purchase exemptions from military service.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Citizenship Project instructors use the draft wheel to teach multiple interconnected civics concepts: the concept of military service, the powers of the president during wartime, the distinction between written law and its social implementation, and the reality of American social conflict around issues of equity and justice.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Students examine the physical object and hundreds of draft cards found inside the wheel when it was donated to the museum, bringing tangible evidence of the randomness, scale, and human cost of conscription.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> An educator explains the historical context of the riots, detailing how low-income Irish immigrants, angry that the wealthy could buy their way out of the draft, rioted for multiple days in response to what they perceived as systematic injustice.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Students then respond with intellectual recognition of patterns beyond the historical moment: as one Citizenship Project participant expressed, "I think it is important for us to know that these things happened in the past so we can better understand what happens here today."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This student's comment reveals how engagement with historical artifacts can bridge past and present, encouraging Citizenship Project participants to recognize how conflicts over equity, access, and the fairness of legal systems persist across historical periods and continue shaping contemporary American life.</p>
<p>The draft wheel also exemplifies how Citizenship Project pedagogy deliberately complicates nationalist narratives by presenting American history honestly, including periods of serious social conflict and injustice. The Civil War is taught not simply as a triumphant narrative of national preservation or antislavery heroism, though it encompasses both those elements, but rather as a moment when the nation tore itself apart and when even the Union Army's desperate need for soldiers created profound social tensions around the fairness of conscription. For immigrants preparing for naturalization, this nuanced historical understanding communicates that American citizenship is not a straightforward inheritance of predetermined values but rather an ongoing contested project requiring critical engagement and moral judgment. The Citizenship Project's willingness to present the Draft Riots and draft wheel alongside nationalist narratives about Lincoln's leadership teaches students that coherent citizenship requires holding multiple truths simultaneously: Lincoln's leadership was crucial to preserving the Union, yet the draft system he implemented generated legitimate grievances about class justice; the Civil War preserved the nation, yet its methods imposed terrible costs on ordinary citizens.</p>
<h2>The Louisiana Purchase Document and Diplomatic Memory</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project employs as a teaching tool an original document related to the Louisiana Purchase, the massive territorial acquisition that doubled the size of the United States in 1803.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> The civics examination includes a question about major historical events expanding American territory, and the Louisiana Purchase provides an ideal historical example for discussion.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> However, what makes the Citizenship Project's approach to this artifact distinctive is its attention to physical detail and the way small, seemingly insignificant elements enhance memory and historical understanding. The document includes a wine stain left by Napoleon, who signed the agreement as part of the diplomatic negotiations between France and the United States.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> When students examine the document, educators encourage them to notice this stain and to reflect on what it represents: not an abstract diplomatic agreement but rather a human moment in which a powerful political leader sat down to compose a document that would reshape the continent, and in doing so, he spilled wine on the paper.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Citizenship Project educators report that this small detail proves remarkably effective for enhancing student memory and engagement. As one student explained her reaction to observing the wine stain: "When you think about it you think about the fact that he was just a regular human. I'm a wine drinker so I think about it like it happens to me."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This student's comment illustrates a crucial insight about object-based learning: concrete, specific details humanize historical figures and make historical events more memorable and emotionally resonant than abstract facts could ever accomplish. The wine stain transforms Napoleon from an abstract historical figure into a human being subject to the same minor accidents and inconveniences as contemporary people, creating a psychological bridge between the student and the historical moment. Furthermore, this small humanizing detail serves as a memory anchor, helping students retain the fact that Napoleon's France sold the Louisiana territory to the United States, a connection essential for passing the civics examination. The pedagogical insight underlying this approach reflects broader understanding within educational psychology that distinctive, emotionally engaging details enhance long-term retention more effectively than dry fact memorization.</p>
<h2>Franklin D. Roosevelt's Leg Braces and Disability History</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project incorporates into its curriculum an examination of Franklin D. Roosevelt's leg braces, the adaptive devices that allowed Roosevelt to function publicly despite the paralysis caused by polio.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This artifact becomes relevant to the Citizenship Project curriculum when students study twentieth-century American presidents and the domestic policies enacted during the Great Depression and World War II.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> However, the historical lesson connected to Roosevelt's leg braces extends significantly beyond basic biographical facts. Roosevelt worked extensively to conceal his disability from the American public, constructing elaborate systems to maintain the appearance of mobility and physical strength, believing that revelation of his paralysis might undermine public confidence in his leadership.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a></sup> The steel railings built into his vehicles allowed him to pull himself into seated positions while leg braces snapped into place, creating visual impressions of standing and walking, managed through careful staging of photographs and public appearances.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a></sup> For decades after his presidency, this reality remained largely hidden from public view, with FDR's true condition known primarily to his closest associates and family members.</p>
<p>When Citizenship Project students encounter Roosevelt's leg braces in the museum, educators facilitate discussion about disability, leadership, and the relationship between public image and private reality.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> One student expressed the impact of this learning experience directly: "I admire him more now."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This comment reveals how understanding the full complexity of a historical figure's life experience deepens appreciation and identification rather than diminishing it. Furthermore, this encounter with Roosevelt's disability invites discussion of broader questions about how American society has treated people with disabilities across historical periods and how contemporary accessibility standards and protections for people with disabilities represent progress from earlier eras. The Citizenship Project's inclusion of Roosevelt's leg braces thus extends beyond biographical detail to encompass larger historical conversations about marginalization, adaptation, resilience, and the evolution of American civil rights understanding.</p>
<p>Notably, the inclusion of Roosevelt's leg braces in Citizenship Project curriculum also connects to contemporary discussions about representation and historical memory. After FDR's death, debate emerged about whether the FDR Memorial should acknowledge his disability visually, with some arguing that the memorial should show him in a wheelchair alongside traditional standing statues.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a></sup> This debate became significant enough that President Bill Clinton ultimately asked Congress to mandate the addition of a second sculpture explicitly depicting FDR in a wheelchair, and in 2001, a new statue showing FDR seated in a wheelchair was added to the memorial.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a></sup> For Citizenship Project students, learning about Roosevelt's disability and the memorial debate raises contemporary questions about historical representation and how new perspectives on historical figures require reconsideration of how we memorialize them. This kind of critical engagement with history demonstrates that understanding the past is not a static exercise but rather an ongoing process of reinterpretation in light of changing values and understanding.</p>
<h2>The Star-Spangled Banner and National Identity</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project utilizes the "Defence of Fort M'Henry," the poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, as a primary source for teaching about the War of 1812 and the national anthem.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The civics examination includes a question asking examinees to identify the national anthem, and the Citizenship Project connects this factual question to the historical context of the poem's composition and the events that inspired Key's writing.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Students in the program examine copies of the original document, hearing the words of "O say, can you see, by the dawn's early light" read aloud, often experiencing a moment of recognition as they realize the text contains the opening lines of the national anthem.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The educational value of this encounter extends far beyond factual memorization of the anthem's name, however.</p>
<p>The historical context surrounding the poem's composition provides rich material for discussing American military history, naval warfare, national resilience, and the symbolic power of the flag itself. On September 13-14, 1814, the British Royal Navy bombarded Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor, shelling the fort relentlessly for twenty-five hours as part of the broader War of 1812.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> Francis Scott Key, a lawyer who had boarded a British ship to negotiate the release of an imprisoned American physician, was forced to remain aboard during the bombardment, unable to know the outcome of the attack until dawn broke and he could see whether the American flag or the British Union Jack flew over the fort.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> The flag that Key witnessed flying over the fort following the American victory was a massive garrison flag measuring thirty by forty-two feet, with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, that had been sewn together by Baltimore resident Mary Young Pickersgill and her workers earlier in 1813.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a>,<a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> This flag, now preserved at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, represents one of the most iconic symbols of American history, having survived nearly two hundred years while bearing visible marks of its presence during the bombardment.</p>
<p>For Citizenship Project students, engaging with the documentary record of the "Defence of Fort M'Henry" connects multiple historical lessons simultaneously. The poem exemplifies how Americans have constructed narratives of national identity around moments of military victory and resilience. The fact that Key's poem was set to the tune of a popular English song demonstrates cultural hybridity and suggests that American national identity itself emerges through adaptation and reinterpretation of existing cultural forms.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> Additionally, the poem's history of circulation and canonization as the national anthem reflects changing understandings of national identity: "The Star-Spangled Banner" was not officially designated as the national anthem until 1931, more than a century after Key wrote the poem.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> This historical trajectory teaches students that national symbols develop meaning through use and cultural adoption rather than through a single moment of official designation, a perspective that can help immigrants understand how they themselves become part of constituting American national identity through participation and belonging rather than through some previous essential qualification.</p>
<h2>The Boston Massacre and the Rule of Law</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project addresses the civics examination question "What is the rule of law?" through engagement with the historical events surrounding the Boston Massacre and the trial that followed.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> The rule of law, defined as the principle that nobody is above the law and everyone must follow the law, is a foundational American civic concept yet one that can be difficult for students to understand and articulate.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> The Boston Massacre, occurring in 1770 when British soldiers fired on a crowd of colonists in Boston, killed five colonists including Crispus Attucks, an African American man.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> The incident emerged from tensions between colonial resentment of British military occupation and a minor altercation between British soldiers and colonists over a disputed bill.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> Crucially, the trial that followed the Massacre demonstrated the principle of rule of law in action: despite enormous public pressure to convict the soldiers, lawyer John Adams agreed to defend them, arguing that the soldiers deserved a fair trial regardless of public sentiment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> Adams' position that the soldiers should receive fair legal representation, even though doing so risked his reputation and law practice, exemplified his understanding that rule of law requires impartial legal proceedings even when they are politically unpopular.</p>
<p>Citizenship Project educator Samantha Rijkers, a green card holder from the Netherlands serving as project manager and class teacher, identified the rule of law question as among the most challenging to pair with an artifact, yet ultimately created a powerful connection by linking it to John Adams' role in the Boston Massacre trial.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> She explained her pedagogical approach: "I connected that to the Boston Massacre because John Adams actually represented the British soldiers and he stated, 'I did this because the rule of law is more important.' If we're just going to judge these people and let mob rule rule the country, then we are not going to be a civilized nation."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This connection transforms rule of law from an abstract principle into a historical narrative about difficult choices and moral courage. Adams prioritized the principle that all people deserve fair trials over the political expediency of satisfying angry colonists demanding vengeance. For Citizenship Project students, understanding this history provides concrete narrative grounding for the abstract principle of rule of law, demonstrating how the concept operates in practice and what it requires of citizens and institutions.</p>
<h2>Native American History and the Indian Removal Act</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project deliberately incorporates into its curriculum discussion of Native American history and the displacement of indigenous peoples, even though these topics do not comprise the majority of the civics examination questions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> Educator Samantha Rijkers explained the pedagogical reasoning: "That was very important to me because those are often groups that are not included in the questions on the test, but we want to show that they're also part of American history and that the history of the United States is very complicated. And we think that's important for new citizens to know."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> To facilitate this discussion, the Citizenship Project utilizes artifacts including a statue of Osceola, the Florida Seminole leader who resisted the forced removal of his people from their lands.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a></sup> Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act, which mandated the forced relocation of indigenous peoples from their homelands to designated territories west of the Mississippi River, represents one of the darkest chapters in American history, resulting in tremendous suffering and death among displaced Native American populations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>By including Native American history in the Citizenship Project curriculum despite its limited presence on the civics examination, educators communicate that comprehensive citizenship education requires understanding the nation's full historical experience, including its treatment of indigenous peoples. This pedagogical choice reflects a commitment to what might be called historically inclusive citizenship education, in which new Americans learn not only the official narrative of national development but also the counter-narratives and suppressed histories of marginalized groups who have experienced American power and expansion as conquest and dispossession. For immigrants coming from nations with their own histories of colonization, genocide, and indigenous displacement, this honest engagement with American indigenous history may provide points of connection and recognition, suggesting that critical citizenship involves understanding both the achievements and the grave failures of the national project.</p>
<h2>Secondary Historical Materials and Documents</h2>
<p>Beyond sculptural objects, the Citizenship Project employs various documentary sources including the "Defence of Fort M'Henry," portions of the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and various other historical documents held within the New York Historical Society's extensive manuscript and library collections.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12" id="cite-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> The New York Historical Society's library holds over twenty thousand linear feet of archival materials including family papers, business records, and organizational collections documenting American and New York history from the seventeenth century through the present.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a>,<a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup> These collections provide an extraordinary resource for citizenship education, allowing educators to present the original words and materials through which American history has been documented and understood rather than relying on summaries or quotations in textbooks.</p>
<p>Students examining the Emancipation Proclamation encounter Abraham Lincoln's original language freeing enslaved people in the rebellious Confederate states, understanding how the document was limited in scope and dependent upon Union military victory for enforcement.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup> This documentary examination complicates simplistic narratives of immediate emancipation and highlights the complicated process through which slavery's legal status changed during and after the Civil War. Similarly, engagement with the Constitution itself, whether through direct examination of historical copies or through careful study of specific constitutional provisions, grounds abstract civics concepts in the actual language chosen by the founding generation. These documentary sources function not as distant historical artifacts but rather as primary evidence through which students can develop their own historical interpretations and understanding, mirroring the kinds of historical thinking required of professional historians and scholars.</p>
<h2>Student Demographics, Outcomes, and Program Impact</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project has served students from remarkably diverse geographic and linguistic backgrounds since its inception in summer 2017. Early cohorts included students from the Dominican Republic, Spain, Jamaica, Russia, Haiti, Ecuador, and the Netherlands, among many other nations, bringing to the program varied prior experiences of migration, education, and relationship to American institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The program has reached over ten thousand students through courses both at the museum and across New York City, expanding to community organizations, schools, and neighborhoods where it is needed most.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Notable partnerships have included the International Rescue Committee's Immigration Opportunity Center, through which the Citizenship Project provided extended ten-week courses to populations struggling with the civics examination.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a></sup> These partnerships have demonstrated significant learning gains: in IRC partnership programs, students' average performance on civics questions improved from four out of ten correct before participating in the program to eight out of ten correct after completing the ten-week course, a doubling of performance that suggests powerful pedagogical effectiveness.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Student testimonials provide compelling evidence of the program's impact beyond test preparation. One participant, Ingrid Kaminski, who had been in the United States for fifty-seven years before taking the course, found that engagement with museum artifacts and American history deepened her appreciation and commitment to her adopted nation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> Another student, Hiroshima Aguero, who had immigrated from the Dominican Republic only eight months before enrolling in the course, expressed how learning American history through museum objects enriched her understanding: "For me, America's always been a great country. And learning about the culture and, well deeper, and about the history is even more important. And it makes you feel very happy, and it makes you feel you actually made the right decision of coming over."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> These testimonials reveal that the program's impact extends far beyond helping students pass the civics examination to transforming their emotional and intellectual relationship to American history and their sense of belonging in their new nation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Citizenship Project students have responded to their classroom experiences by becoming museum members, indicating genuine interest in continuing to engage with the institution and share their experience with family and friends.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> This outcome demonstrates that museum-based citizenship education can generate lasting institutional loyalty and cultural participation beyond the immediate program context. Students who previously had never visited a museum or who had negative associations with educational institutions have been drawn into ongoing relationships with the New York Historical Society, expanding the constituency for cultural institutions and demonstrating the potential of museums to serve as welcoming civic spaces for communities who have been historically marginalized from cultural institutions.</p>
<h2>National Expansion and Replication of the Model</h2>
<p>Recognizing the power and effectiveness of the Citizenship Project model, the New York Historical Society has established a national partnership program whereby museums across the United States can receive training, curriculum materials, and ongoing support to implement their own Citizenship Project programs in their local communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-47" id="cite-47">47</a></sup> Partner museums have included institutions such as the Clinton Presidential Library in Arkansas, the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History, the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Michigan, the Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri, the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Texas, and the James Monroe Museum in Virginia.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup> This national expansion extends the impact of object-based citizenship education beyond the New York metropolitan area, allowing museums throughout the country to serve immigrant communities in their regions using similar pedagogical approaches adapted to local collections and regional history.</p>
<p>The partnership model acknowledges that different regions of the United States have distinct histories and different museum collections available for educational purposes. A museum in Florida might draw upon artifacts related to the Civil War, the American South, or Native American history specific to the southeastern United States. A museum in the Great Plains might feature materials documenting westward expansion, Native American history of the region, or agricultural development. By training museums nationwide and providing curriculum materials while allowing for adaptation to local contexts, the New York Historical Society has multiplied the impact of its original innovation, creating a distributed network of museum-based citizenship education across the country. This expansion also ensures that immigrants in regions outside major metropolitan centers have access to the kind of object-based citizenship education that has proven so effective in New York City.</p>
<h2>Educational Significance and Broader Implications</h2>
<p>The Citizenship Project represents a significant intervention in American citizenship education, demonstrating that museums have crucial roles to play in preparing immigrants for naturalization and citizenship. The program challenges the assumption that civics education is the exclusive domain of schools and government agencies, demonstrating instead that cultural institutions holding historical artifacts and documents possess distinctive pedagogical resources for teaching citizenship. Furthermore, the program's methodology of object-based inquiry offers lessons not only for immigrant education but for American historical education more broadly. Students in K-12 schools and college programs might benefit from the kind of careful, prolonged engagement with primary sources that Citizenship Project educators facilitate, developing interpretive skills and historical thinking rather than merely memorizing isolated facts.</p>
<p>The program also advances conversations about inclusive history and the representation of marginalized experiences within American narratives. By deliberately including Native American history, African American experiences, immigrant histories, and the perspectives of working-class people, the Citizenship Project demonstrates that citizenship education can embrace historical complexity and acknowledge diverse voices rather than presenting a univocal official narrative. This approach proves particularly powerful for immigrants who have experienced their own nations' contested histories and who understand that all national narratives are constructed and contestable rather than simply discovered in historical fact. For these immigrants, engaging with American history that honestly confronts the nation's failures and achievements alongside each other may prove more convincing an</p>
