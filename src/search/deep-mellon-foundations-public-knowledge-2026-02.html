        <h1>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge Program and Summer 2026 Internship Opportunities</h1>
<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation represents one of the most significant philanthropic forces in American cultural and intellectual life, with a deep commitment to supporting the preservation, access, and equitable distribution of knowledge through its Public Knowledge program<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>. As of 2024, the foundation maintained an endowment of approximately $8 billion and distributed over $475 million in program grants, demonstrating its substantial capacity to shape the landscape of libraries, archives, and cultural memory institutions across the United States and beyond. The Public Knowledge program specifically focuses on creating and preserving the cultural and scholarly record that documents society's complex, intertwined humanity, while simultaneously working to increase equitable access to deep knowledge that helps build informed, heterogeneous, and civically engaged communities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. For students and early-career professionals, the foundation offers multiple summer internship positions in 2026 that provide invaluable exposure to philanthropy, foundation operations, and the funding landscape for critical knowledge institutions. This comprehensive analysis examines both the foundational mission and strategic initiatives of the Public Knowledge program as well as the specific opportunities available through summer 2026 internship positions, providing detailed information about application requirements, compensation, and the broader context of foundation work in the contemporary cultural moment.</p>
<h2>History, Mission, and Organizational Structure of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</h2>
<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation emerged from a distinctive philanthropic legacy rooted in early twentieth-century American wealth and cultural patronage. Named after the financier, industrialist, art collector, and philanthropist Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937), the foundation was formally established in 1969 when Andrew's children, Ailsa Mellon Bruce and Paul Mellon, merged two philanthropic entities they had founded separately, creating an institutional framework for systematic grantmaking in the arts and humanities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>. Since its inception more than fifty years ago, the foundation has been guided by a core belief that the humanities and arts are essential to human understanding and that everyone deserves access to the beauty, transcendence, and freedom that can be found in these domains<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. This foundational commitment has evolved significantly over time, particularly during the contemporary era when the foundation has sharpened its focus on social justice as a central organizing principle across its grantmaking activities.</p>
<p>The foundation's scale and influence in American philanthropy cannot be overstated. With approximately $7.9 billion in endowment assets as of 2023, the Mellon Foundation stands as the nation's largest private supporter of the arts and humanities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>. Over the course of its existence, the foundation has awarded approximately 19,000 grants, distributing roughly $572 million in 2022 alone and continuing to expand its annual grantmaking commitments, which have increased by more than $200 million annually since 2018. According to recent financial statements, the foundation disbursed over $475 million in program grants in 2024, alongside grantmaking operations totaling approximately $72 million. This substantial financial capacity allows the foundation to support initiatives ranging from individual artist fellowships to major infrastructure projects that reshape how American cultural institutions operate and serve their communities.</p>
<p>The foundation's organizational structure reflects its commitment to systematic, strategic grantmaking across multiple priority areas. The Mellon Foundation conducts its grantmaking through four core program areas: Higher Learning, which focuses on advanced humanistic inquiry and the advancement of knowledge production in academic settings; Arts and Culture, which celebrates the power of the arts to challenge, activate, and nourish the human spirit; Public Knowledge, which supports the creation and preservation of the cultural and scholarly record; and Humanities in Place, which works to present and preserve American history through museums, archives, and public spaces<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>. In addition to these four major focus areas, the foundation supports three smaller Presidential Initiatives: the Monuments Project, which focuses on reshaping America's commemorative landscape; Puerto Rico, which funds cultural and educational initiatives in that territory; and Imagining Freedom, which explores new frameworks for understanding freedom in contemporary America. This multi-program structure allows the foundation to address diverse aspects of American cultural and intellectual life while maintaining coherence around its central mission of building just communities enriched by meaning and empowered by critical thinking<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The Public Knowledge Program: Strategic Vision and Core Objectives</h2>
<p>The Public Knowledge program represents a distinctive and increasingly significant component of the Mellon Foundation's overall grantmaking strategy, positioning itself at the intersection of knowledge preservation, equitable access, and cultural memory in the digital age<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. According to the program's official proposal guidelines, Mellon's Public Knowledge program supports the creation and preservation of the cultural and scholarly record—vast and ever-expanding—that documents society's complex, intertwined humanity<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. This formulation moves beyond simple archival work or collection management to assert that the preservation of knowledge is fundamentally connected to how societies understand themselves and their histories. The program works specifically with archives, presses, and a range of university, public, and other local, national, and global libraries that are foundational to knowledge production and distribution in culture and the humanities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. By targeting these institutional types, the foundation acknowledges that knowledge infrastructure—the systems, institutions, and practices through which information is stored, organized, discovered, and accessed—is a critical but often underfunded component of democratic societies.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the Public Knowledge program is to increase equitable access to deep knowledge that helps to build an informed, heterogeneous, and civically engaged society<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. This goal incorporates multiple dimensions of concern: equity, which addresses historical and ongoing inequalities in who has access to which knowledge; depth, which prioritizes substantive, complex knowledge over superficial information; and democracy, which assumes that informed civic participation depends on widespread access to reliable, diverse sources of understanding. Through its work, the foundation aspires to cultivate networks and maintainable infrastructure, expand digital inclusion, and ensure that more authentic, reflective, and nuanced stories are revealed, preserved, and told<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. These aspirations reflect a recognition that the digital transformation of knowledge institutions creates both opportunities and challenges: digital tools enable unprecedented access to collections, but they also require significant investment in infrastructure, expertise, and sustainable business models that many cultural institutions struggle to afford.</p>
<p>The Public Knowledge program pursues three interconnected strategies to advance its mission<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. First, the program prioritizes the preservation of original source materials with a particular emphasis on materials from historically underrepresented cultures and populations. This strategic focus acknowledges that traditional archival and collecting practices have often centered on materials from dominant groups, leaving significant gaps in the historical record regarding the experiences, perspectives, and achievements of marginalized communities. Second, the program funds efforts to advance equitable digital access, digital inclusion, and the digitization of original sources, which benefits libraries, archives, and presses. This strategy recognizes that digitization is not merely a technical process of converting analog materials to digital formats, but rather a complex undertaking that requires attention to accessibility standards, metadata practices, user interface design, and sustainable preservation approaches. Third, the program creates and supports networks to increase knowledge sharing among institutions and communities. This networked approach acknowledges that individual institutions, even well-resourced ones, cannot preserve the entirety of the cultural and scholarly record alone, and that systems-level coordination can enhance efficiency and broaden impact<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Public Knowledge program's emphasis on culturally responsive practices and community engagement represents a significant evolution in archival and library practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. Rather than imposing standardized approaches from outside, the program encourages grantees to develop practices that are responsive to the specific needs, values, and priorities of the communities whose histories they document. This approach recognizes that archival standards, while important, are human constructs that can be revisited and revised to better serve diverse populations and communities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. The program also acknowledges that many communities and organizations lack the resources and formal training to document their own histories, and that untold stories from the past remain inaccessible to researchers and the public<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. By providing funding for community-based archival work, the program seeks to democratize the practice of historical documentation and to ensure that a broader range of voices and experiences are preserved for future generations.</p>
<h2>Key Initiatives, Grantmaking Priorities, and Recent Awards</h2>
<p>The Public Knowledge program has developed a robust portfolio of grantmaking initiatives that address different aspects of knowledge preservation, access, and infrastructure. One of the most significant recent developments is the Faculty Organizing for Community Archives Support (FOCAS) initiative, which represents a collaborative effort across nine universities in the United States and Canada to support paid internships at community archives<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. The three-year FOCAS program, funded by the Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge program, places Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) students in paid internships at over 40 community-based archives. Dominican University received a $750,000 grant over three years to support this initiative, which provides several MLIS students with paid internships to help create local community archives using culturally responsive archival practices<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. These students work to select, appraise, arrange, describe, preserve, digitize, and exhibit materials, records, and other archival pieces that tell a community or organization's story, history, culture, and heritage<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. The FOCAS initiative also supports curricular development, offsets costs for community archives, and funds student participation in conferences and professional associations. By investing in both student training and community institutional capacity, the program seeks to build long-term infrastructure for community-based cultural preservation work.</p>
<p>Another major initiative supported by the Public Knowledge program is the digital preservation infrastructure work coordinated through partnerships with institutions like the Pratt Institute School of Information and New York University's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) program. The Mellon Foundation awarded $1.28 million to support the next cycle of the Digital Preservation Outreach and Education Network (DPOE-N), extending the project for another four-year cycle. The DPOE-N addresses the critical need for libraries, archives, and museums (LAM) professionals to develop digital preservation skills, recognizing that as archives have become increasingly digital, many institutions lack the funding to build this capacity. Since receiving Mellon Foundation grants in 2020 and 2022, DPOE-N has provided free workshops on topics such as web archiving, command line tools, and inclusive digital preservation practices to over 200 professionals across 39 states and Puerto Rico, while also providing funding for cultural heritage professionals to access training and purchase emergency hardware. The new $1.28 million grant enables DPOE-N to continue programming in Puerto Rico with four in-person workshops over the next four years, includes 20 online workshops on technical and human resource topics, and provides 177 microgrants for LAM professionals to increase access to digital preservation training. All online workshops are offered in both Spanish and English to support Spanish-speaking communities, demonstrating the program's commitment to linguistic accessibility and cultural responsiveness.</p>
<p>The Public Knowledge program has also made substantial investments in regranting initiatives that distribute funds through intermediary organizations to a diverse cohort of grantees. The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), a trusted partner of the Mellon Foundation, administers several major regranting programs funded by Public Knowledge. In July 2023, CLIR received a $5,000,000 award from the Mellon Foundation to bolster the Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices regranting program and related operations. This program creates groundbreaking opportunities for eligible nonprofit organizations in the United States and Canada to digitize materials in any format, with particular emphasis on collections of historically marginalized individuals. By providing essential funding to a diverse cohort of academic, independent, and community-based organizations, CLIR seeks to unlock access to previously unavailable or underutilized collections, fostering broader recognition of the immense value in preserving resources that document the history of marginalized people and advance social justice. Since its establishment in 2015, the Digitizing Hidden Collections program has distributed over $28 million to digitally capture and share rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions.</p>
<p>In July 2025, the Mellon Foundation announced an additional $3,000,000 award to CLIR to continue its Recordings at Risk regranting program, which funds the preservation of rare and unique audio and audiovisual content on degrading or obsolete time-based media such as magnetic tape, wax cylinders, wire recordings, or early film. The program will launch two competitions in fall 2025 and 2026, awarding funds for digital reformatting projects to take place in 2026-2028. Notably, Canadian nonprofit organizations will be eligible to apply for the first time in the history of this program, representing an expansion of the initiative's geographic scope. Since the program's 2016 inception, Recordings at Risk has awarded nearly $6 million over eleven grant cycles for 190 reformatting projects, making it a proven model for supporting time-based media preservation. The independent review panel assesses proposals based on the potential scholarly or public impact of proposed projects, the urgency of undertaking those projects, the viability of applicants' plans for long-term preservation, and the overall cost-effectiveness of the proposals.</p>
<p>The Public Knowledge program has also maintained a commitment to funding innovative projects that address emerging challenges in knowledge production and access. For example, the program supported the development of Dartmouth College's Reviews in Digital Humanities, which provides scholarly peer review for digital scholarship projects, thereby extending traditional standards of academic rigor to new forms of knowledge production. The program has also funded initiatives like the College of Wooster's Black Web Archives Collective, which documents and preserves digital materials related to Black history and experience; organizations working on projects like Whose Knowledge and the Invisible Histories Project, which interrogate whose knowledge is represented in major knowledge platforms; and partnerships with established institutions like the Internet Archive and the American Council of Learned Societies. Through these varied initiatives, the Public Knowledge program demonstrates its commitment to addressing both foundational infrastructure challenges and emerging questions about whose knowledge counts, how it is preserved, and who has access to it.</p>
<h2>Application and Funding Guidelines for the Public Knowledge Program</h2>
<p>For organizations seeking to apply for Public Knowledge funding, the Mellon Foundation has established a detailed set of proposal guidelines and funding parameters designed to ensure clarity and facilitate high-quality applications<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. The grant application consists of four pieces: information on the proposed grant and organization; a proposal narrative document that provides detailed information on the proposed work; supplemental documents; and a budget and budget description outlining how funds would be spent<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Organizations must provide an organizational overview (one paragraph) describing the organization and its mission, unless the applicant is a college or university, which are exempt from this requirement. They must also submit a grant summary or abstract in one paragraph that summarizes the proposed work for which they seek Mellon funds during the grant period<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. For fiscally sponsored grants, applicants must include a brief statement indicating that the proposal is being submitted by the fiscal sponsor to support the sponsored project.</p>
<p>The substantive proposal narrative addresses eight key questions about the work proposed<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. First, organizations must articulate the goals of the proposed work during the grant period and, if relevant, explain how the work will move them toward goals beyond the end of the grant<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Second, they must describe what activities Mellon funding would support, including a timeline for implementation<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Third, organizations must identify significant collaborating partners and describe how they would participate in the work<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Fourth, if the grant will support any staff positions in part or in whole, applicants must explain how these positions will contribute to the proposed work<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Fifth, organizations must address sustainability, describing their plans for sustaining grant activities or programs beyond the end of the grant term<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Sixth, if the proposed work involves technology development, organizations must describe the technology and explain the reasons for its selection<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Seventh, applicants must discuss potential challenges that could impact the proposed work and explain how these challenges have informed their planned activities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Eighth, organizations must address grant-produced content and outputs, describing what content or work products will be created, how they will be distributed or made available for educational or charitable purposes, and what rights or permissions must be secured<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The budget component of the application is equally important and subject to specific guidelines and restrictions<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. The foundation uses set expenditure categories including personnel and benefits, equipment and supplies, contracted services, direct charitable activities, indirect costs, and other categories<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Applicants can add up to five additional custom categories for each proposal<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. A budget should be submitted for each reporting period, with the name of the period and clear start and end dates<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Reporting periods are typically one year long but can vary if projects have different timelines<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Personnel costs should be presented with detailed information showing the position funded by the proposed grant (for example, Program Director: $100,000/year base salary, 20% benefit cost, 50% allocation to the project for 2 years, 3% increase in year 2 = $121,800)<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Funding for fellowships, artist fees, and consultants should be presented within the corresponding expenditure categories<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Mellon Foundation has established clear restrictions on what types of projects and expenditures it will fund through the Public Knowledge program<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. The foundation does not generally fund tuition, K-12 education and programming, fundraising events, or direct funding for individuals, though it does support individual artists and scholars through regranting programs and intermediaries<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. Additionally, the Public Knowledge program specifically does not fund capital costs and construction projects, scholarships, financial aid, or study abroad programs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. The foundation also does not generally fund indirect costs for colleges and universities, governmental entities, fiscal sponsors, or for organizations that are not public charities<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. These restrictions reflect the foundation's strategic priorities and its effort to ensure that grant funds are directed toward substantive programmatic work rather than administrative or overhead costs, particularly for well-resourced institutional types that should absorb these costs within their own budgets.</p>
<p>Organizations should be aware that if their proposed grant is large relative to the total income of their organization, it could impact their organization's ability to satisfy the public support test for public charity status, which is an important consideration for nonprofit tax status<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. For fiscally sponsored projects, applicants should describe the rate at which fiscal sponsor fees would be calculated<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. The application process involves submission through the foundation's Fluxx grant management system, and the foundation notes that proposed grants approved by Mellon will require grantees to enter into a standard grant agreement with the foundation before the grant is funded<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>. This grant agreement and the finalized proposal establish the terms of the grant, including reporting requirements, milestone expectations, and other conditions of the award<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup>.</p>

All communication with candidates is sent via the foundation's ADP system, and applicants should note that this is a full-time seasonal position<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Program Intern, Public Knowledge Program</h3>
<p>The Program Intern position for the Public Knowledge program is specifically designed for graduate students seeking exposure to philanthropy and a deeper understanding of the funding landscape for public libraries and community memory initiatives. Reporting to the Program Associate, the Program Intern will participate in a hybrid role supporting the Public Knowledge program and will have the opportunity to contribute to project development related to community memory and public libraries, gain experience in program documentation, qualitative analysis, and the development of calls for proposals. This internship is particularly well-suited for candidates interested in understanding how foundations support libraries and archives, and those who wish to see firsthand how philanthropic strategy translates into grantmaking priorities and funding announcements.</p>
<p>The specific responsibilities of the Program Intern include conducting desk research in response to queries from Program Staff, attending convenings, local site visits, and internal planning meetings, taking notes for meetings with internal and external partners, retrieving and analyzing information from Mellon's Fluxx database and grant records, and drafting planning materials and program documentation related to calls for proposals. The position provides significant learning opportunities about how the foundation evaluates emerging issues in the library and archives sector, how funding priorities are developed, and how the foundation communicates with potential grantees. Qualifications for this position require training in or immediate preparation for a library and information science graduate program, or a program in the humanities or social sciences, demonstrated either through current enrollment in such a program or recent completion during Winter 2025 or Spring 2026. Candidates should have a demonstrated interest in public libraries and community memory projects, programs, and initiatives. Additionally, the position requires candidates to have excellent oral and written communication skills, excellent analytical and critical thinking abilities, organizational skills with precise attention to detail, and a demonstrated commitment to socially just, equitable, and community-driven approaches to research.</p>
<p>The compensation for the Program Intern position is $28–$29 per hour, with the amount of pay determined by qualifications, unique skills, credentials, or experience expected to impact the candidate's contribution, as well as market data and the foundation's internal pay equity framework. Mellon maintains a hybrid work schedule, with three days per week in person at the foundation's Manhattan offices. Candidates should apply by submitting a cover letter describing fit for the position and a resume by Friday, February 27th, 2026. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<h3>Research Intern, Public Knowledge Program</h3>

All internship positions maintain the foundation's hybrid work schedule with three days per week in person at the Manhattan offices<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Broader Context: The Mellon Foundation and Contemporary Knowledge Infrastructure Challenges</h2>
<p>Understanding the Public Knowledge program requires broader context about the challenges facing knowledge institutions in the contemporary digital age. The National Endowment for the Humanities and other federal funders have historically supported libraries, archives, and museums, but many institutions report underfunding relative to the scope of their missions and the growing demands placed upon them<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a></sup>. The Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded $266.7 million through grantmaking, research, and policy development in 2024 to advance, support, and empower America's museums, libraries, and related organizations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a></sup>. While this is significant, it is substantially less than the Mellon Foundation's commitment and reflects broader underfunding of cultural infrastructure in the United States<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a></sup>. The Knight Foundation, Arcadia Fund, and other major philanthropies also support knowledge access initiatives, but the Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge program represents one of the most substantial and strategic commitments to this work. As one observer noted, universal public knowledge—which includes resources like libraries, archives, and Wikipedia—is comparatively underfunded relative to other paths to knowledge, including K-12 education, higher education, and journalism.</p>
<p>The digital transformation of knowledge institutions has created both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. Digital tools enable researchers and the public to access cultural materials from anywhere with an internet connection, dramatically expanding who can engage with historical documents, photographs, audio recordings, and other primary sources. However, digitization requires substantial investment in equipment, expertise, sustainable infrastructure, and ongoing preservation efforts. The National Archives Strategy for Digitizing Archival Materials outlines a comprehensive, system-wide approach to making analog records available online as quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively as possible, while also emphasizing the preservation benefit of digitization for reducing wear and tear on fragile originals. This strategy acknowledges that traditional funding sources may not be sufficient to achieve digitization goals and that partnerships, where partners provide resources for digitizing, can expand the scale of digitization beyond what individual institutions can accomplish. The Mellon Foundation's investments in digital preservation infrastructure, community archives support, and digitization initiatives directly address these infrastructure challenges.</p>
<p>The push for equitable access to knowledge has gained particular urgency in recent years, as scholars, archivists, and librarians have recognized that traditional collecting and preservation practices have often centered dominant narratives while marginalizing the experiences and perspectives of communities that have been historically excluded from cultural institutions. The commitment of the Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge program to funding digitization of hidden collections and amplifying unheard voices reflects this recognition. By supporting initiatives that prioritize materials documenting marginalized histories and communities, the foundation seeks to expand whose stories are preserved and accessible for future scholarship and public understanding. This work intersects with broader social justice initiatives within the Mellon Foundation, which since 2020 has placed social justice front and center across its grantmaking in the humanities, libraries, archives, and more.</p>
<h2>The FOCAS Initiative and Community Archives Internships: A Model for University-Community Partnership</h2>
<p>The Faculty Organizing for Community Archives Support (FOCAS) initiative exemplifies how the Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge program creates innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community-based organizations<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. FOCAS is a collaborative of faculty from nine universities in the United States and Canada that formed to support paid internships at community archives, funded by a three-year grant from Mellon's Public Knowledge program. This collaborative structure reflects the program's recognition that building sustainable infrastructure for community archiving requires coordination across institutions and regions. The three-year program will see MLIS students placed in over 40 archives, supporting curricular development, offsetting costs for community archives, and funding student participation in conferences and professional associations. By providing both financial support for students and resources for community archives, the program creates a mutually beneficial arrangement: students gain practical experience and mentorship in professionally-led community archive projects, while community archives gain staffing capacity and the benefit of student research and technical skills<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Dominican University's $750,000 three-year grant from the Mellon Foundation's Public Knowledge program exemplifies how FOCAS operates in practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. The grant provides several Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) students with paid internships to help create local community archives using culturally responsive archival practices<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. Students help select, appraise, arrange, describe, preserve, digitize, and exhibit materials, records, and other archival pieces that tell a community or organization's story, history, culture, and heritage, and may also help collect and record oral histories<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. Funding from the grant covers tools and equipment necessary to carry out the project and supports a community archives "mini lab" for students, community partners, and communities with archiving, preservation, and digitizing needs<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. Several potential partners interested in building a historical archive have been identified, including a suburban municipality, an ethnic community cultural center, and a community organizing coalition<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. One goal is to make these records and stories searchable for the public, recognizing that preservation alone is insufficient if materials remain inaccessible<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A particularly innovative aspect of the FOCAS model is its emphasis on reciprocal learning and cultural responsiveness in archival practice<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a></sup>. Rather than imposing standardized archival practices from outside, the program encourages partnership and mutual learning. As Dr. Cecilia Salvatore, coordinator of Dominican's archives and cultural heritage certificate program, noted, "We have our arch</p>
