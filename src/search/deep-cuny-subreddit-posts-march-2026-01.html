        <h1>CUNY Reddit Discussions in March 2020: Student Voices During the COVID-19 Transition to Distance Learning</h1>
<p>The abrupt transition of the City University of New York's 25 campuses to remote instruction in mid-March 2020 generated extensive discussion across social media platforms, particularly on Reddit, where students documented their immediate reactions, concerns, and evolving experiences with unprecedented disruption to their educational lives.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a></sup> These online conversations captured a critical moment when institutional decision-making intersected with student realities, revealing the pressures, anxieties, and logistical chaos that characterized the early pandemic's impact on higher education. The Reddit threads from this period serve as an important historical record of how students processed sudden dorm closures, concerns about academic policies, technological challenges, food security, mental health crises, and the broader social upheaval occurring simultaneously. Analysis of these subreddit posts demonstrates that while official announcements came from government officials and university administrators, the authentic student voice emerged from grassroots online communities where peers shared their struggles, sought advice, and collectively grappled with navigating an entirely new educational paradigm in real time.</p>
<h2>The Announcement and Immediate Student Reactions: Discovering Distance Learning Through Social Media</h2>
<p>The transition to distance learning at CUNY did not originate from official university communications but rather from an announcement made via Twitter on March 11, 2020, when New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that "Starting March 19, @CUNY and @SUNY will move to a distance-learning model for the rest of the semester."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup> This mode of announcement itself became a subject of considerable student discussion and criticism on Reddit, as many CUNY community members found themselves learning about the closure not through their colleges' official channels but through social media platforms. The disconnect between how information was disseminated and how students actually received it highlighted broader communication failures within the university system during the crisis. Reddit threads from March 10 onwards captured student outrage and confusion about the rapid escalation of restrictions, with one documented tweet recording "one student's outrage over the mere announced one-day closure of John Jay College of Criminal Justice" on March 10, 2020, before the full system-wide distance learning mandate was announced.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-41" id="cite-41">41</a></sup> This early reaction reflected the bewilderment that characterized the initial response, as the situation evolved so rapidly that students struggled to keep pace with new information and institutional decisions.</p>
<p>The Reddit discussions from March 11-13, 2020 documented the period immediately following the governor's announcement, when students and faculty alike scrambled to understand the implications of this transition. One particularly significant Reddit thread from March 18, 2020 featured a "struggling student at CUNY's LaGuardia Community College" documenting their perspective on the newly implemented distance learning model.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup> These early posts reveal that students were grappling not just with academic concerns but with fundamental logistical questions about how their lives would change. The timeline of events moved with startling speed—on March 13, 2020, the administration at College of Staten Island decided to close the library due to the pandemic, transitioning reference services to virtual delivery.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a></sup> Within days, the entire CUNY system had shifted, yet the infrastructure and communication systems to support this transition were woefully unprepared.</p>
<h2>Dorm Closures and Logistical Nightmares: Housing Insecurity as an Unexpected Crisis</h2>
<p>A dominant theme in March 2020 CUNY Reddit discussions involved the sudden and traumatic closure of residential dormitories across the system's campuses. Hunter College residents received only three days' notice that dormitories would close on March 27, 2020, creating what students described in Reddit posts as an impossible logistical situation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> The rush to vacate hundreds or thousands of students from close quarters in crowded college dorms in the midst of an escalating pandemic represented a crisis that many student posts highlighted as both ridiculous and potentially dangerous. One student recounted in detail on Reddit how "Hunter gave dorm residents only three days' notice that the dorms would be closing on March 27. This quick turn-around time would lead to many issues. Many students did not have the resources to move out in just three days."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> Reddit discussions captured the desperation of students trying to coordinate moves with family members, friends, and moving companies during what was already a chaotic period when many people were sheltering in place.</p>
<p>Reddit threads from this period documented the particular burden on working-class CUNY students, who could not easily arrange transportation or temporary housing. The posts revealed that "there was little time to coordinate or arrange moving out plans, from the transportation of possessions to finding a place to live. Further, most CUNY students had jobs and the move would need to take place in the middle of a work week!"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This observation underscored how the rapid dorm closure policy failed to account for the socioeconomic realities of CUNY's student body, many of whom could not absorb the cost of emergency relocation or the loss of housing stability during a crisis. The crowding involved in the forced evacuation itself represented a public health threat, as "having less than three days for this amount of people (plus others who are helping residents) to move out of a crowded college dorm also resulted in swarms of people in close proximity in the midst of a pandemic brought about by airborne virus."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The housing crisis prompted numerous Reddit posts from students describing their return to overcrowded family homes, particularly in the outer boroughs of New York City and surrounding areas. One student returning to Queens with their brother who attended SUNY Albany noted that this sudden displacement "sat well with me or my family" as they joined an "increasingly crowded family home in Queens."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> Reddit discussions frequently referenced how students lost not just physical space but also the psychological refuge that campus had provided, particularly for first-generation and low-income students for whom college campuses had served as essential infrastructure providing access to technology, study spaces, and community resources. The forced return to family homes meant students had to navigate family dynamics, reduced privacy, and often suboptimal study conditions precisely when they needed to transition to remote learning.</p>
<h2>Academic Adjustment and Pedagogical Concerns: The Chaos of Course Transition</h2>
<p>The transition to distance learning prompted extensive Reddit discussion about how professors were adapting courses, implementing new technologies, and establishing policies for the remainder of the semester. Multiple Reddit threads documented in the CUNY Digital History Archive capture students' perspectives on how instructors were handling the unprecedented situation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16" id="cite-16">16</a></sup> One thread from September 3, 2020 featured "discussion and critiques of the ways CUNY instructors have increased the workload" for students in online courses, suggesting that many faculty members reacted to the transition by intensifying rather than adapting their pedagogical expectations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a></sup> This observation generated considerable discussion among students who felt overwhelmed not only by the logistical changes but by what they experienced as additional academic pressure during an already stressful period.</p>
<p>Reddit posts from March 2020 also documented specific academic concerns about how certain courses with laboratory or hands-on components could feasibly transition to an online format. Students in STEM fields posted about the particular challenges of completing lab work, field research, or other experiential learning components remotely, a concern that extended to senior thesis projects and capstone experiences that required in-person research or experimentation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup> The subreddit discussions reveal that students and faculty alike had limited clarity on how these courses would proceed, what accommodations might be available, and how grades would be determined in this new context. One Reddit post from April 2, 2020 documented "one student's concerns over the assessment policies of their class if they were to" continue remotely, indicating ongoing uncertainty about evaluation methods and their implications for academic progress and career trajectories.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Faculty technological capacity became another frequent topic in Reddit discussions. One student post reflected on the transition to online learning, noting that they found "many professors were not technologically equipped to move their lectures online, perhaps the instructional training was not enough, or more is required."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> This observation captured a widespread sentiment among the CUNY student community that the shift to distance learning exposed significant deficiencies in instructional technology support and faculty training. Reddit threads documented particular frustration when professors appeared unprepared, when learning management systems malfunctioned, when video conferencing software caused disruptions, or when basic technical issues prevented classes from functioning at all. The subreddit posts suggest that while some faculty members adapted quickly and creatively, others struggled significantly, and students bore the consequences of this uneven preparedness.</p>
<h2>Internet Access and Digital Divides: Connectivity as an Invisible Crisis</h2>
<p>A critical theme in March 2020 CUNY Reddit discussions involved the challenge of ensuring all students had adequate internet access for distance learning. One online teaching resource developed by CUNY faculty on March 16, 2020 acknowledged that "internet access is absolutely vital to have, but there are many people in the world who don't have" it.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-39" id="cite-39">39</a></sup> This recognition of the digital divide proved prescient, as Reddit discussions throughout March and into April 2020 documented students struggling with inadequate broadband, unreliable connections, and the cost of internet service. For many low-income CUNY students, the transition to distance learning meant either paying for new internet connections in their homes or attempting to participate in classes via mobile hotspots, which proved inadequate for sustained online learning, particularly when multiple household members needed to access the internet simultaneously.</p>
<p>Reddit posts documented the particular challenges faced by students in overcrowded housing returning to family homes after dorm closure, where existing internet infrastructure had not been designed to support multiple simultaneous users participating in online classes, work, and personal activities. Students posted about the stress of trying to find quiet spaces within shared housing to participate in synchronous online classes, of competing for bandwidth with family members, and of the embarrassment of connection failures during video calls with professors and classmates. The subreddit discussions reveal that while the university made the transition to distance learning mandatory, the underlying assumption that all students possessed reliable home internet connectivity proved fundamentally incorrect and exacerbated educational inequities.</p>
<h2>Financial Precarity and Food Insecurity: Material Survival During the Transition</h2>
<p>The CUNY Reddit posts from March 2020 frequently addressed the economic crisis facing students as a result of the pandemic and the sudden shutdown of in-person economic activity. The first positive case of COVID-19 among the student body was confirmed in early March 2020, and by mid-March, the cascading effects on employment, housing, and food security became evident.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> According to survey data conducted by CUNY's School of Public Health in late May 2020, the economic toll had become severe: "one in four households with children have reported a child experiencing hunger as a result of the COVID-19 health crisis," with "about one in three of these households report[ing] that since the epidemic started a child had lost weight and almost one in four report[ing] that a child had been hungry because they couldn't get enough food to feed them."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Reddit discussions from March 2020 captured the emerging food insecurity crisis before these formal surveys were conducted, with students posting about the loss of jobs, reduced work hours, and inability to purchase food. The panic buying phenomenon documented in broader news coverage of grocery stores during March 2020 intersected with students' financial precarity, as they competed with other consumers for limited supplies while simultaneously facing job loss or reduction in hours.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a></sup> Students in Reddit threads discussed how they would manage to eat, where they would obtain food assistance, and how the sudden loss of employment income would affect their ability to pay for housing, tuition, and other basic necessities. The subreddit posts reveal that for many CUNY students, the transition to distance learning was inextricably linked with material survival concerns that no amount of pedagogical adaptation could address.</p>
<p>The impact on working-class students proved particularly severe. One student noted that "my parents, as well as many of my peers, were forced to confront wide-spread death after being classified as 'essential.'"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This comment captured the dual crisis facing many CUNY students: the need to work in essential services during a deadly pandemic while simultaneously trying to participate in distance learning from overcrowded home environments. Reddit discussions documented students who were healthcare workers, grocery store employees, transit workers, and other essential workers struggling to attend classes while facing direct exposure to COVID-19 and the trauma of witnessing mass casualties. These subreddit posts reveal a dimension of the pandemic's impact on higher education that purely pedagogical discussions often overlook—the fundamental incompatibility between the material conditions of many students' lives and the expectations of academic participation.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Crisis: Anxiety, Depression, and Psychological Toll</h2>
<p>The mental health impact of the sudden disruption to university life emerged as a central theme in CUNY Reddit discussions throughout March and into the spring and summer of 2020. One particularly eloquent Reddit post from September 2020 reflected back on the previous months and noted that the student had struggled significantly with "loneliness, stress, and loss" during the pandemic period.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> The subreddit discussions capture an emerging mental health crisis among students who were suddenly isolated from peer communities, campus support systems, and the structured academic environment that had provided psychological stability.</p>
<p>One student writing about their experience acknowledged that "my own struggle with mental health had also been exacerbated by CUNY's closing. As a majority of CUNY students commute to school from home, our college campuses often acted as a safe haven from the harsh realities of being a student from a low-income and working-class background. Campuses provide access to technology, a sense of community, and support resources for many of us."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This insight, shared repeatedly across Reddit threads, highlights how the university closure removed essential mental health supports and community infrastructure that had been particularly important for vulnerable populations. The removal of "frequent in-person check-ins with fellow student club members and friends" proved devastating for students managing anxiety disorders, depression, and other mental health conditions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Survey data collected in April 2020 validated what Reddit posts had been describing anecdotally: "half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup> This prevalence of nearly double the baseline rate of mental health conditions among the student population represented a significant public health emergency. The Reddit discussions documented students describing panic attacks, suicidal ideation, inability to concentrate, and overwhelming despair—mental health crises occurring in isolation within family homes where household members might not understand or know how to support them. The subreddit posts reveal that while formal mental health services theoretically remained available, the transition to remote-only mental health support limited accessibility, and many students did not seek help, either due to stigma, lack of awareness of services, or the overwhelming nature of the crisis.</p>
<h2>Grading Policy Responses and Academic Assessment Uncertainty</h2>
<p>In response to the unprecedented circumstances, CUNY implemented institutional policies designed to mitigate the academic consequences of the transition. On April 1, 2020, CUNY implemented a "Special COVID-19 Flexible Grading Policy" that allowed students to convert letter grades to credit/no credit after grades had been posted, providing flexibility during the crisis.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> Reddit discussions from April and May 2020 documented students discussing and debating this policy—whether they should exercise the option, what implications this might have for graduate school admissions or professional licensure, and how different professors were handling grading standards given the challenging circumstances.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>One Reddit thread from April 2, 2020 posed the question "has anyone been told something rather alarming about the final exam policy on Internet outages?" suggesting that some professors and departments were implementing policies that seemed to place unreasonable burdens on students or failed to account for the technological challenges of remote testing.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup> The subreddit discussions reveal that while the university-level flexible grading policy provided some protection, implementation at the department and course level remained inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. Students posted about frustration with some professors who remained rigid in their expectations, showed little sympathy for genuine hardship, or appeared to take the pandemic as an opportunity to demand more rigorous work rather than scaling back expectations proportional to the crisis.</p>
<p>The flexible grading policy itself became a subject of Reddit debate, with students questioning its implications for GPA calculations, transferability between CUNY colleges, and effects on graduate school admissions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> Some students worried that choosing credit/no credit for certain courses might disadvantage them competitively, while others feared that letter grades from a semester of distance learning would not be looked upon favorably by graduate programs or employers. These subreddit discussions reveal how institutional policies, while well-intentioned, created new sources of stress and required students to make consequential academic decisions during a period when they lacked the psychological resources for careful deliberation.</p>
<h2>Workplace Struggles and Essential Worker Status</h2>
<p>A particular dimension of CUNY student experiences documented in Reddit threads involved the intersection of student status with essential worker status. Many CUNY students worked in healthcare, food services, retail, transportation, or other essential industries, making them unable to shelter in place while attending classes remotely. One student writing retrospectively about their spring 2020 experience noted that "my parents, as well as many of my peers, were forced to confront wide-spread death after being classified as 'essential.'"<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This comment connected the academic crisis to a broader labor crisis affecting working-class CUNY students and their families.</p>
<p>Reddit discussions documented the particular cruelty of being required to participate in online classes while working retail or healthcare shifts in an underfunded, under-protected essential workplace. One student mentioned that their mother, a healthcare worker during the height of the pandemic surge in New York, "was forced to go to work because her unit was so understaffed" despite the dangerous conditions and critical lack of personal protective equipment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> The subreddit posts reveal how students tried to balance the competing demands of employment in dangerous conditions, participation in distance learning courses, and the psychological processing of the trauma of witnessing mass death in healthcare settings. These experiences underscore how the transition to distance learning did not occur in isolation but was embedded within a broader public health emergency that disrupted every dimension of students' lives.</p>
<h2>The Broader Context: Racial Justice, Inequality, and Systemic Inequity</h2>
<p>The Reddit discussions from March 2020 occurred not only during the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic but also at a moment when systemic racism and inequality became increasingly visible. One student reflecting on their spring 2020 experience wrote that "the challenge of living in tight quarters with my family during the pandemic were made more difficult by the necessary protests for Black equality, where New York was also a major epicenter. The CUNY population is largely made up of students of color from all ethnicities and backgrounds."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This intersection of the pandemic crisis with racial reckoning created an additional layer of emotional and psychological complexity for many students.</p>
<p>The Reddit threads frequently connected pandemic-era inequities to broader patterns of systemic racism and inequality affecting communities of color disproportionately. Student posts documented how the pandemic exposed "the economic and political priorities of policymakers as working-class students suffered," with particular emphasis on "heightened racial disparities, and financial precarity" that characterized the impact of COVID-19 on CUNY communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> The subreddit discussions reveal how CUNY students, understanding themselves as part of a predominantly students-of-color community, connected their individual experiences to broader structural inequality and systemic injustice. This political consciousness, articulated across Reddit threads, suggests that many students understood their struggles not as individual failings but as consequences of systemic underfunding and marginalization of public higher education and working-class communities of color.</p>
<h2>Documentation and Historical Preservation: Reddit Posts as Primary Sources</h2>
<p>The Reddit discussions from March 2020 and beyond emerged as historically significant documents precisely because they captured student voices at the moment of crisis. The CUNY Digital History Archive, a participatory project, specifically worked to preserve these discussions, recognizing their value as "personal and institutional documentation, community resources, class projects, and digital" artifacts that chronicle the pandemic's impact on CUNY communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-42" id="cite-42">42</a></sup> The archivists understood that "the archive's three public-facing collections span the closure of the university, the transition to remote teaching and learning, and the resulting activism of the #CutCOVIDNotCUNY movement pushing against austerity in public higher education."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>The decision to archive Reddit threads and social media posts as part of the historical record reflected recognition that these grassroots online conversations often contained more authentic, immediate, and visceral accounts of crisis than official institutional documents. As archivists noted, "that it was the state governor, rather than school" administrators communicating the transition decision "through Twitter" exemplified how institutional authority had fractured during the crisis, and informal communication networks became the primary means through which information and affect circulated among students.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup> The Reddit posts captured not just factual information about what was happening but the emotional experience of living through the crisis, the collective sense-making that occurred as students posted about their experiences and responded to one another's struggles.</p>
<p>The CUNY Digital History Archive's commitment to preserving these materials ensured that what might otherwise have been ephemeral social media discussions became permanent historical documents, available for future research, reflection, and learning. One archivist reflected that "in contemplating interventions in response to the university's transition to online instruction, we worried that life under COVID could further normalize a neoliberal ideology based on techno-solutionist policymaking and procurement practices."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup> This archival consciousness—the recognition that how the crisis is documented and preserved shapes how it will be remembered and learned from—became central to the decision to collect, curate, and preserve student Reddit posts and other social media documentation.</p>
<h2>Patterns of Peer Support and Collective Problem-Solving</h2>
<p>Beyond documenting crisis and complaint, the Reddit discussions from March 2020 revealed significant patterns of peer support and collective problem-solving among CUNY students. Subreddit users posted questions about navigating new university policies, shared resources about accessing benefits or support services, offered emotional support to others describing their struggles, and collectively made sense of an unprecedented situation. One student wrote retrospectively that they found "it more difficult to manage and process my anxiety without the frequent in-person check-ins with fellow student club members and friends," but the Reddit subreddit itself provided a digital alternative for peer connection and support.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The subreddit discussions documented how students helped one another navigate practical problems—finding information about dorm checkout procedures, understanding the flexible grading policy, locating campus food pantries, accessing mental health resources, and troubleshooting technical issues with learning management systems and video conferencing software. While these discussions could not replace in-person community, they provided critical infrastructure for isolated students trying to navigate chaos and uncertainty. The fact that students turned to Reddit rather than waiting for institutional guidance suggests both the failure of official communication channels and the power of peer networks to fill gaps in institutional support.</p>
<h2>Evolution of Discussions Through Spring and Summer 2020</h2>
<p>The Reddit discussions evolved over the weeks and months following the initial March transition. Early threads from March 10-13 focused on immediate shock and confusion about the announcement, practical questions about dorm closure procedures, and efforts to understand what distance learning would mean. By late March and into April, as the transition began to take hold, Reddit posts increasingly focused on the challenges of distance learning, concerns about academic progress, emerging food insecurity, and mental health struggles. Posts from May and June 2020 reflected on the completed spring semester, evaluation of how the transition had gone, concerns about fall 2020 planning, and emerging patterns about which students had been most severely impacted.</p>
<p>One particularly striking evolution involved the increasing awareness and articulation of systemic inequality. Early March posts often framed the crisis in personal or individualized terms—"I'm struggling with this," "I don't know how I'll move out," "I'm worried about my grades." By summer 2020, as documented in later Reddit threads and reflected in retrospective accounts, students increasingly understood their individual struggles as manifestations of broader structural inequities. One student wrote, "the price of socioeconomic inequity had never been clearer in my mind," capturing this shift toward systemic understanding of what had initially appeared as individual challenges.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> The Reddit discussions thus document not just the events of March 2020 but the ongoing process through which individual experience becomes collective consciousness about structural injustice.</p>
<h2>Continuation and Long-Term Impact: Beyond March 2020</h2>
<p>While this research focuses specifically on March 2020 Reddit posts, subsequent subreddit discussions and later reflections reveal the long-term impact of the transition to distance learning. Reddit threads from September 2020 documented students' concerns as they prepared to begin a second semester of remote or hybrid learning, with posts noting that "instructors have increased the workload for students in online courses" and that many students found the online semester "to be more difficult than" the previous semester.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16" id="cite-16">16</a></sup> The subreddit conversations suggest that rather than improving with time, online learning in many cases became more challenging as students and faculty moved beyond the initial crisis adaptation phase.</p>
<p>Later Reddit discussions also documented the emergence of the #CutCOVIDNotCUNY activism movement, through which students and faculty challenged the university system's approach to handling the pandemic and austerity measures that threatened further cuts to public higher education.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a></sup> These discussions reveal how the initial crisis documented in March 2020 Reddit posts evolved into sustained political organizing and advocacy, with students collectively demanding better support for the vulnerable populations within the CUNY system. The progression from individual struggle documented in March 2020 subreddit posts to collective political action by mid-2020 and beyond suggests that the Reddit discussions served not only as documentation of crisis but as the foundation for solidarity and activism.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Reddit as Historical Record and Research Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The comprehensive examination of CUNY Reddit discussions from March 2020 reveals social media platforms as critical infrastructure for peer support, collective sense-making, and historical documentation during times of crisis. While these discussions occurred within a specific historical moment—the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic and CUNY's transition to distance learning—they capture enduring themes about educational equity, systemic inequality, the vulnerability of working-class and students of color, and the limits of institutional responsiveness during crisis. The Reddit posts documented immediate practical problems while simultaneously revealing deeper systemic vulnerabilities in the university's infrastructure, capacity, and commitment to serving its most vulnerable students.</p>
<p>The preservation of these Reddit discussions within the CUNY Digital History Archive and their recognition as valuable primary sources underscore the importance of taking seriously the experiences and voices of students, particularly those most marginalized within higher education. These subreddit posts offer historians, educators, policymakers, and future students crucial insights into how institutional decisions at the moment of crisis disproportionately impact students living in material precarity, while simultaneously revealing the resilience, creativity, and solidarity through which students navigate impossible situations. The March 2020 CUNY Reddit discussions ultimately constitute a rich and complex historical record of how one of the nation's largest public university systems failed to adequately support its students during unprecedented crisis, and how students themselves used available digital tools to document, process, and ultimately organize around these experiences.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6" id="cite-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14" id="cite-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16" id="cite-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-52" id="cite-52">52</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup></p>
