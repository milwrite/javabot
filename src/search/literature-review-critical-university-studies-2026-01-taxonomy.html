        <h1>Critical University Studies: An Examination of Urban Universities, Technology, Institutional Critique, and American Higher Education Transformation</h1>
<p>This comprehensive research review explores the expanding field of Critical University Studies (CUS) with particular emphasis on how urban universities engage with technological systems, reproduce inequality, and negotiate their relationship to publics and communities. Drawing on diverse scholarly perspectives including those of Christopher Newfield, Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, la paperson (K. Wayne Yang), Marc Bousquet, and others, this analysis reveals how American higher education institutions—particularly those embedded in urban centers—have undergone profound structural transformations since the early 2000s. These changes reflect a broader shift from publicly-funded institutions serving democratic and social welfare functions toward privatized, corporatized entities oriented toward market competition, capital accumulation, and the extraction of value from students, faculty, and surrounding communities. The integration of educational technology into this landscape further complicates these dynamics, simultaneously promising enhanced learning experiences while often deepening inequities, exploiting contingent labor, and enabling new forms of surveillance and control. This review synthesizes current scholarship examining these interconnected phenomena, tracing how critical scholars have documented and theorized the neoliberal restructuring of higher education while also imagining alternatives grounded in collective struggle, fugitive study, and decolonial refusal.</p>
<h2>The Emergence and Development of Critical University Studies as a Distinct Intellectual Field</h2>
<p>Critical University Studies emerged as a recognizable field of inquiry during the 1990s and early 2000s, crystallizing a diverse body of scholarship that approached the university not as a neutral or benevolent institution but rather as a site fundamentally shaped by power relations, economic interests, and structural inequalities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup> The field represents a deliberate intellectual and activist intervention, developing what might be characterized as a cold-eyed examination of how higher education has become increasingly oriented toward private gain rather than public benefit. In 2012, Jeffrey J. Williams formally designated this emergent body of work as "critical university studies," giving name to an interdisciplinary conversation that had already been developing through various scholarly venues and activist networks.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-22" id="cite-22">22</a></sup> The field operates with what scholars describe as simultaneously scholarly and activist dimensions—its goal extends beyond mere documentation and analysis to encompass direct intervention in university governance, labor practices, and policy formations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The intellectual lineage of CUS traces back to earlier waves of university criticism, but distinguishes itself through its systematic focus on how neoliberalism and corporatization have restructured higher education institutions at every level.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup> Unlike earlier critical perspectives on academia, CUS emerged from scholars working across institutional hierarchies—not primarily from elite universities as was the case with Critical Legal Studies, but rather from faculty at public universities, adjuncts, graduate students, and community members with intimate knowledge of how privatization operates on the ground.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup> This distributed, multi-positional approach reflects the field's commitment to understanding university transformation through multiple lenses simultaneously: the erosion of tenure and rise of contingency, the explosion of student debt, the capture of research agendas by corporate interests, the displacement of communities by campus expansion, and the colonization of academic labor through technological systems and managerial control.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup> The field's emergence in the 1990s, according to Williams, reflected scholars' growing realization that the rosy predictions made about higher education's future in the 1980s—such as those offered by William G. Bowen—had proven entirely false, as budget cuts, tuition hikes, and the dismantling of public support became the dominant trajectory.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Critical University Studies represents more than academic critique; it functions as what Williams describes as an "activist knowledge," explicitly recognizing that analysis must connect to movements for change and that "internal disruption is the only thing that will keep the default future of fragmented decline from continuing indefinitely."<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup> This commitment to activist intervention distinguishes CUS from purely descriptive scholarship about higher education, positioning scholars within the field as participants in ongoing struggles to transform universities rather than detached observers. The field has demonstrably influenced campus activism, student movements around debt and tuition, faculty unionization efforts, and broader public conversations about higher education's relationship to democracy and the common good.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19" id="cite-19">19</a></sup> At the same time, CUS scholarship has generated substantial intellectual output addressing the mechanisms through which contemporary universities reproduce and intensify social inequality rather than alleviating it—a core concern animating the field since its inception.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7" id="cite-7">7</a></sup></p>
<h2>Neoliberalism, Privatization, and the Restructuring of American Public Higher Education</h2>
<p>The transformation of American higher education from a predominantly publicly-funded system oriented toward public purpose to a privatized system based on tuition-dependent, market-oriented models represents the central diagnosis offered by CUS scholarship.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-21" id="cite-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This restructuring did not occur suddenly or through explicit policy declaration but rather accumulated incrementally across decades as deliberate policy choices at federal and state levels redirected resources away from institutional funding toward individual student loans, reframed education as private investment in individual earnings rather than public good, and positioned market mechanisms as the appropriate regulatory framework for educational delivery.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The Rivlin Report of 1969 marks a critical policy inflection point, establishing the intellectual framework for treating higher education primarily as benefiting individuals rather than society broadly, thereby justifying a shift from institutional subsidies to student-financed models.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Christopher Newfield, among the most significant voices in CUS, has documented how the combination of managerialism and privatization has produced coordinated effects across students, instructors, researchers, and frontline staff.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-1" id="cite-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4" id="cite-4">4</a></sup> States, facing their own fiscal pressures and ideological commitments to tax reduction, progressively disinvested from public universities beginning in the 1990s, reducing per-student appropriations even as enrollment grew.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Rather than maintaining public commitment through adjusted funding, universities responded by dramatically increasing tuition, shifting the revenue burden entirely onto students and their families.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> This process created a vicious cycle: as public universities relied increasingly on tuition revenue rather than state appropriations, they pursued enrollment growth—particularly of out-of-state and international students who pay higher tuition—thereby signaling to state populations that these institutions no longer served their local interests, further justifying political disinvestment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The contemporary funding crisis for public universities reflects the accumulated weight of these policy choices. As of fiscal year 2024, state support for public higher education rose only slightly after pandemic-related increases, but this increase masks deeper structural problems.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The share of public college revenue supported by student tuition fell below 40 percent for the first time since 2010, reflecting recent declines in tuition revenue as enrollment patterns have shifted.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a></sup> Yet this apparent "good news" obscures the precarious situation facing most public institutions, which face simultaneous challenges of declining enrollments, flat or declining state appropriations, decreased federal research funding under proposed Trump administration budgets, and mounting operational costs.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> The University of California system alone faces potential losses of $4 billion to $5 billion annually from federal funding cuts, forcing administrators to contemplate tuition increases, hiring freezes, and layoffs.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> Regional public universities and community colleges face even more severe pressures, unable to compete for out-of-state enrollment or to rely on research revenue like flagship institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>This fiscal crisis, scholars argue, was deliberately engineered as a strategy to justify and enable further privatization. The "balance wheel" function of state higher education budgets—where lawmakers cut higher education first when facing shortfalls, then restore it in better times—has increasingly become permanently broken, with cuts persisting even as fiscal conditions improve.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-28" id="cite-28">28</a></sup> University administrators and conservative policymakers have converged around a narrative suggesting that public funding is inherently limited and that therefore universities must operate increasingly like private businesses, generating revenue through market mechanisms rather than relying on public appropriations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> This logic justifies tuition-driven enrollment strategies, corporate partnerships, real estate development schemes, and the conversion of universities into what scholars term "company towns" operating comprehensive systems of employment, housing, retail, and financial services for their employees and students.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<h2>Urban Universities, Real Estate Accumulation, and Community Displacement</h2>
<p>A particularly significant dimension of CUS research concerns the transformation of urban universities into engines of real estate development and capital accumulation at the expense of surrounding communities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> Urban universities occupy distinctive positions within their cities: they function as massive employers, landlords, developers, and generators of demand for housing and services, yet they operate with substantial tax advantages and often exercise significant political authority over zoning, land use, and urban governance.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> Davarian L. Baldwin, in his influential work examining how universities plunder cities, has documented how major urban universities from Columbia University in Harlem to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to Arizona State University in downtown Phoenix have pursued aggressive expansion strategies that displace working-class residents, particularly residents of color, while claiming to pursue community revitalization.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University's redevelopment of East Baltimore illustrates the mechanisms through which university-led development operates as a form of racialized dispossession.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> The university displaced 742 Black families from the neighborhood to construct a mixed-use biotech park, subsequently offering housing subsidies that effectively entrench gentrification by raising housing costs to levels unaffordable to the previous residents who had been displaced.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> The university frames these subsidies as community engagement and benefit, obscuring how they function to prevent the return of those expelled by academic expansion.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Similar patterns replicate across urban universities: Columbia's Manhattanella expansion in West Harlem displaced minority-owned businesses and historic structures, replacing them with glass towers; UC Berkeley's campus expansion pressures have contributed to housing crises and the displacement of students and long-term residents; and NYU's expansion in Greenwich Village has transformed neighborhoods from working-class residential areas into zones of luxury consumption oriented toward university affiliates.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>What scholars term the "UniverCity" model reflects how urban universities have increasingly moved beyond their traditional educational mission to become comprehensive urban developers and governors.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> Universities exercise substantial political authority through their ability to influence zoning decisions, through private police forces that operate with public authority, through tax exemptions that redirect public funds away from municipal services, and through control of land use and development patterns.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a>,<a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> The prosperity generated through university-led development is extracted directly from public resources—the tax revenues and public services that would otherwise be available for city residents—while universities present themselves as benevolent community anchors generating jobs and investment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup> In reality, Davarian Baldwin argues, urban universities often harm the communities in which they operate by raising property values and rental costs, limiting the ability of working-class residents to afford housing, displacing cultural institutions and businesses, and using campus police to surveil and control neighborhood residents in ways that serve university interests rather than community safety.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-43" id="cite-43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania's displacement of the Black Bottom neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s established a pattern that continues today.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> When the university and the West Philadelphia Corporation allied to declare the Black community as "blighted," used eminent domain to seize land, and bulldozed 5,000 residents' homes to construct the University City Science Center, they pioneered what became a standard urban university development strategy: frame demolition and displacement as urban renewal and community improvement.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup> Contemporary university expansion strategies continue this logic, presenting expansion as inevitable and beneficial while representing community displacement and cultural loss as unfortunate but necessary side effects of progress.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-46" id="cite-46">46</a></sup></p>
<h2>Academic Labor, Precarity, and the Contingent Faculty System</h2>
<p>Critical University Studies has devoted substantial scholarly attention to documenting the systematic degradation of academic working conditions through the expansion of contingent labor—adjunct and part-time faculty—who now constitute the majority of college instructors in the United States.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> Marc Bousquet's foundational work on how universities operate as low-wage labor systems documents how the academic job market functioned as an elaborate system of controlled deception, perpetuating a fiction of genuine opportunity while systematically producing proletarianization for the vast majority of doctorate holders.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-40" id="cite-40">40</a></sup> Universities deliberately expanded graduate programs far beyond positions available, creating a supply of eager labor willing to accept poverty wages, precarious conditions, and promises that contingency was temporary and would eventually resolve into permanent employment.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> These promises never materialized; instead, contingency became institutionalized as a permanent feature of academic employment, with universities recognizing that securing cheap instructional labor serves institutional financial interests far better than converting these positions to tenure-track appointments.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>The precarity of academic labor intensified dramatically through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, with tenure-track positions declining as a percentage of total faculty appointments while contingent positions expanded.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a></sup> As of recent surveys, over 70 percent of faculty members hold contingent positions, including adjuncts, term-limited lecturers, graduate student instructors, and other non-tenure-track appointments.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> Adjunct faculty particularly experience extreme exploitation: survey data reveals that 43 percent of adjuncts are paid below $15 per hour; 24 percent below $10 per hour; and 16 percent below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> While adjuncts are classified as part-time, 40 percent report working more than 40 hours weekly for their university employer or employers, with almost all reporting expected work outside the classroom for which they receive no compensation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act explicitly carves out teachers from protections otherwise offered to workers, leaving adjunct faculty without legal recourse against wage theft or requirements for timely payment despite exploitative conditions affecting nearly one in five adjuncts who report delayed paychecks.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a></sup> The intellectual justification for this exploitation rests on professionalization ideology—the notion that academics should accept poverty wages because teaching and research constitute meaningful professional work transcending economic calculation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a></sup> Scholars like Bousquet reveal this ideology as fundamentally mystificatory, obscuring the fact that adjunct labor is overwhelmingly women and people of color, is concentrated in humanities and social sciences departments, and serves institutional financial interests by transferring revenue from educational mission to administrative overhead and elite faculty compensation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-26" id="cite-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-29" id="cite-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-31" id="cite-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>The contingency system functions as what Bousquet terms a "job system" that serves institutional functions precisely because it remains unjust and precarious.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> By maintaining surplus populations of aspirant academics willing to work for poverty wages, the system keeps salaries for tenured faculty depressed, prevents any bargaining leverage for workers, enables flexible hiring and firing responsive to enrollment fluctuations, and ensures that labor remains politically neutralized rather than organized into collective demands.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> University administrators have actively prevented faculty from organizing collectively to resist these conditions, despite widespread recognition among faculty of what Bousquet terms the "employment injustice" that characterizes contemporary academic labor.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup> The betrayal of junior scholars by senior faculty who either look away from these injustices or defend them as inevitable further entrenches precarity, as older faculty members benefit from tenure systems and resist measures that might constrain hiring flexibility for their institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-37" id="cite-37">37</a></sup></p>
<h2>Digital Technology, Educational Software, and the Transformation of Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>The expansion of educational technology into higher education represents another critical domain of CUS investigation, particularly as scholars examine how digital systems enable new forms of labor exploitation, surveillance, and capital accumulation while promising educational democratization and improved pedagogy.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup> The Learning Management Systems (LMS) market alone—dominated by platforms such as Canvas, Blackboard, and Google Classroom—had grown to an estimated $15.3 billion industry in 2025, with projections reaching $37.9 billion by 2026.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a></sup> These platforms function as essential infrastructure for contemporary higher education, centralizing course materials, assessments, communications, and increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence for automated grading, tutoring, and student analytics.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-23" id="cite-23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The rapid expansion of online learning, particularly accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic when institutions shifted to remote instruction, exemplifies technology's central role in contemporary higher education restructuring.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a>,<a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a>,<a href="#ref-38" id="cite-38">38</a></sup> In fall 2019, approximately 2.4 million students pursued exclusively online education; by 2020, pandemic-induced remote learning drove that number to 7 million, representing a nearly 200 percent increase.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup> While many institutions have returned to in-person instruction, online enrollment remains substantially elevated, with the CHLOE 10 Report revealing that 88 percent of colleges and universities plan to expand online offerings in the next three years as of 2025.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a></sup> This expansion reflects not primarily pedagogical innovation but rather institutional recognition that online education can generate revenue while reducing costs—fewer instructors needed, less campus infrastructure required, enrollment no longer constrained by physical capacity.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-32" id="cite-32">32</a>,<a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Critical scholars examining educational technology emphasize how digital systems perpetuate rather than resolve existing inequities in higher education.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-20" id="cite-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> While educational technology advocates promise personalized learning, improved access, and enhanced pedagogical effectiveness, empirical evidence reveals more complex dynamics. The digital divide—differential access to reliable broadband connectivity, appropriate devices, and digital literacy—continues segregating students by race, class, geography, and disability status.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup> Rural and tribal communities face particular barriers, with 22.3 percent of rural Americans and 27.7 percent of Tribal lands residents lacking fixed broadband access compared to only 1.5 percent in urban areas.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-45" id="cite-45">45</a></sup> Among students living in poverty, 26 percent lack internet access or have only dial-up service, compared to 4 percent of students living above 185 percent of the poverty threshold.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-48" id="cite-48">48</a></sup></p>

<p>The pedagogy enabled by LMS platforms raises concerns about the banking concept of education that critical pedagogues have long critiqued.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup> Rather than fostering dialogue, critical thinking, and student agency, LMS environments often replicate hierarchical, instructor-centered models mediated through digital interfaces, with students as passive consumers of content delivered through software interfaces.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-13" id="cite-13">13</a></sup> The incorporation of AI-driven automated grading systems introduces new dimensions of potential bias and equity concerns, as algorithms trained on biased historical data perpetuate and often amplify discrimination against students from underrepresented groups.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-3" id="cite-3">3</a></sup> Critically, the expansion of online learning has not reduced tuition costs; indeed, students in online programs frequently pay tuition equal to or exceeding that of comparable in-person programs, with private for-profit online institutions charging $17,000 annually compared to $10,000-15,000 at nonprofit institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-35" id="cite-35">35</a></sup></p>

<h2>The Undercommons and Fugitive Intellectual Practice: Harney and Moten's Radical Critique</h2>
<p>Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's concept of the Undercommons represents one of the most influential and contestatory contributions to Critical University Studies, offering a theoretical framework for understanding university opposition and alternative modes of intellectual practice.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Rather than envisioning reform or transformation of existing universities, Moten and Harney propose that critical intellectuals should inhabit the Undercommons—a subaltern, fugitive space within and against universities where collective study, abolition, and revolutionary praxis become possible.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> This framework emerged from Moten and Harney's 2004 publication of "The University and the Undercommons: Seven Theses" in Social Text and was subsequently elaborated in their 2013 collection <em>The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study</em>, which rapidly circulated among precarious academics, graduate students, and activist scholars.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The Undercommons concept explicitly rejects what Moten and Harney call the "negligence of the critical academic"—the tendency of progressive scholars to position themselves as above the systems they critique, to maintain professional respectability while claiming radical intentions, and to fail to commit to the material, collective projects that genuine opposition requires.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup> Rather, Moten and Harney advocate what they term becoming "subversive intellectuals"—unprofessional, disloyal, and passionate scholars who inhabit the university's hidden spaces and labor processes, who refuse the university's professionalization imperative, and who dedicate themselves to practices of "black study" oriented toward collective liberation rather than individual advancement.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup> The Undercommons is not conceived as a comfortable refuge but rather as an "unsafe neighborhood," a dangerous space where institutional survival and individual safety are continually jeopardized by commitment to radical practice.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Moten and Harney's framework emphasizes the university's dependence on what they call "underlabor"—the clandestine labor of marginalized workers, precarious faculty, students, and others who perform essential functions yet remain unrecognized or exploited by official university structures.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> While universities require this labor to function, they cannot acknowledge it, cannot incorporate it into their official narratives, and actively work to suppress it.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup> The Undercommons recognizes and valorizes this subaltern labor while simultaneously calling for its refusal—refusing to accept the university's terms, refusing professionalization, refusing the fiction that universities serve enlightenment and public good when in reality they function as instruments of state power, militarization, and capitalist accumulation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-2" id="cite-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5" id="cite-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11" id="cite-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The concept has proven extraordinarily generative within activist academic circles, particularly among PhD students and precarious scholars navigating the impossibility of professional advancement and the ethical crises of working within exploitative institutions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Many scholars have adopted Moten and Harney's framework to theorize their own positions of marginalization and to justify commitments to teaching, solidarity, and activism that exceed disciplinary and professional expectations.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> However, the work has also generated substantive critique, particularly around the question of whether radical rhetoric can simultaneously inhabit and subvert institutional structures or whether, as some critics contend, the attempt to be radical while maintaining academic employment inevitably reproduces the professional individualism that Moten and Harney critique.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-8" id="cite-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Robin Kelley, analyzing Black student struggle on campuses, engages both the promise and the limits of Moten and Harney's Undercommons framework.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Kelley notes the tension between student demands for inclusion, diversity, and cultural belonging versus the framework's call for refusal and revolutionary opposition.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Black students seeking validation, recognition, and institutional transformation may understandably resist a framework that calls for abolition of the university as currently constituted.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> Yet Kelley also emphasizes what Moten and Harney insist upon—that the university will never truly welcome or love its marginalized students, that inclusion without liberation remains a form of oppression, and that students possess intellectual capacities and legacies extending far beyond what universities recognize or enable.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup> The question becomes how Black students and others positioned at the margins might simultaneously seek material improvements in institutional conditions while maintaining critical distance from the university's redemptive myths about its own nature and potential.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-49" id="cite-49">49</a></sup></p>
<h2>Decolonial Refusal and Alternative University Frameworks</h2>
<p>The concept of decolonization, as developed by scholars like la paperson (K. Wayne Yang), extends CUS analysis into questions of settler colonialism, Indigenous land relationships, and the possibility of reimagining universities beyond neoliberal capture.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup> La paperson's 2019 work <em>A Third University Is Possible</em> has become increasingly influential in activist academic circles, proposing that colonial systems of education always contain within them decolonial riders—figures and movements that work against the educational machines that have constituted them.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> Rather than viewing universities as potentially reformable or perfectible institutions, la paperson suggests that genuine decolonization requires imagining entirely different forms of knowledge work and intellectual community, what the framework terms the "Third University" existing within but against the corporate First World University.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>The Third University framework emphasizes that universities—particularly in the United States context—have always been institutions fundamentally entangled with settler colonialism, with land dispossession, with racial capitalism, and with war.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> These are not unfortunate aberrations or deviations from universities' proper educational mission but rather constitute the universities' core function and organizational logic.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> Consequently, decolonization cannot mean including Indigenous peoples or knowledge systems into existing institutional structures; rather, it demands reimagining educational relationships from the ground up, with Indigenous sovereignty, land return, and refusal of capitalist accumulation as foundational commitments.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> Scholars associated with this framework, including K. Wayne Yang and Eve Tuck, emphasize what they call "decolonial refusal"—the strategic rejection of university logics and the cultivation of alternative intellectual communities oriented toward different goals and relationships.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-9" id="cite-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27" id="cite-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>The University of Washington's "Activating the Third University" initiative represents one institutional attempt to operationalize decolonial frameworks, though scholars debate whether such initiatives within existing institutions can accomplish genuine decolonization or whether they inevitably become absorbed into institutional reform logics.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a></sup> The project aims at making revisions to the university's global engagement guidelines, holding conversations on decolonial work emerging within Critical University Studies, and creating space for conversations with Indigenous communities to inform institutional practices.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a></sup> Yet critics note the tensions inherent in attempting decolonization within institutions that fundamentally depend on settler colonial logics for their existence, land base, and funding structures.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-30" id="cite-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>The decolonial turn in CUS scholarship emphasizes what scholars describe as "unlearning"—the necessity of unlearning the Western educational frameworks, epistemologies, and hierarchies through which most academics have been trained and within which they continue to operate.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup> This unlearning process does not simply mean adding non-Western knowledge to existing curricula but rather involves what some scholars term a fundamental reorientation of how education itself is understood, valued, and conducted.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup> Decolonization work in academic contexts increasingly emphasizes centering Indigenous, African, Asian, and Latin American knowledge systems not as supplementary or enriching additions to Western education but as foundational frameworks that can reshape how knowledge creation, dissemination, and intellectual community operate.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-50" id="cite-50">50</a>,<a href="#ref-53" id="cite-53">53</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Crisis of Public Purpose and the Commercialization of Academic Knowledge</h2>
<p>Central to CUS analysis is the diagnosis that American universities have fundamentally abandoned commitments to public purpose and democratically-accountable knowledge production in favor of commercialized models oriented toward privatized intellectual property, market-driven research agendas, and corporate partnerships.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> Scholars observe that universities have systematically shifted away from understanding higher education as a public good—something benefiting society broadly through democratic citizenry, informed cultural conversation, and knowledge accessible to all—toward understanding it as a private good generating benefits for those individuals and corporations who can afford access and who control intellectual property rights.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a>,<a href="#ref-58" id="cite-58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>The management of intellectual property within universities exemplifies this transformation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> Whereas earlier frameworks treated faculty scholarship and discoveries as intellectual commons available to the scholarly community and the public, contemporary university policies increasingly mandate institutional ownership of faculty intellectual property, restrict publication rights, and enable licensing arrangements that concentrate knowledge behind corporate paywalls and proprietary access restrictions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> Universities justify these policies through arguments about necessity—that research requires significant institutional investment and therefore institutions must capture returns through commercialization to sustain research enterprises.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> However, critics observe that these arrangements often do not financially benefit institutions broadly or support research missions but rather concentrate revenues among administrators, corporate partners, and elite researchers while constraining broader knowledge access and imposing restrictions on what gets researched and how findings are disseminated.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-57" id="cite-57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>The corporatization of academic research funding represents another dimension of this knowledge commodification.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> Universities that once viewed corporate partnerships as supplementary to publicly-funded research now actively recruit industry partnerships and position themselves as sites where corporate R&D can be conducted with the benefits of university infrastructure, tax advantages, and legitimacy.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> While individual faculty members negotiate research agreements that technically protect academic freedom and publication rights, broader institutional pressures favor partnerships that generate institutional revenue, lead to commercializable discoveries, and align research agendas with corporate interests.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup> The cumulative effect reshapes research priorities toward applied, commercializable research and away from basic research, theoretical work, and inquiry addressing questions that cannot generate market-valuable outcomes.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-44" id="cite-44">44</a>,<a href="#ref-60" id="cite-60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>Jonathan Gyurko's recent work emphasizing "publicization" as an alternative framework argues that institutions of any ownership structure—private nonprofit, public, or proprietary—can become more publicly-oriented through deliberate choices to operate less exclusionarily across multiple dimensions including funding sources, governance structures, institutional goals, accountability mechanisms, equity commitments, and educational philosophy.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup> Rather than accepting that universities must operate primarily for private benefit, Gyurko proposes an "Exclusion Test" examining whether institutional practices and structures exclude people or restrict access to knowledge and participation.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup> This framework suggests that universities could choose to operate more like public goods by embracing direct public funding, democratic governance, accessible course offerings, free or low-cost enrollment, and commitment to preparing citizens for democratic participation rather than primarily for individual wage-earning.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Fiscal Crisis, Student Debt, and Economic Precarity</h2>
<p>The expansion of student lending as the primary mechanism for financing higher education represents what scholars term a fundamental inversion of public responsibility.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a>,<a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a>,<a href="#ref-55" id="cite-55">55</a></sup> As federal and state governments reduced direct institutional funding and as tuition rose to fill resulting gaps, students increasingly financed their education through federal loans administered by the Department of Education, private lending institutions, and families' personal savings or borrowing.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a>,<a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> The cumulative outstanding student debt in the United States reached approximately $1.62 trillion as of 2024, distributed across 42.8 million borrowers, with the average bachelor's degree recipient accumulating between $29,300 and $35,200 in debt depending on institutional type and timing.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>This debt load produces multiple harmful effects extending far beyond education into economic, social, and political domains.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> Student debt obligations reduce household net worth substantially—Federal Reserve research reveals that households with student debt hold net worth three times lower than households without education debt.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> This wealth destruction disproportionately affects younger Americans and households of color, deepening racial wealth gaps. Student debt also reduces formation of small businesses, as individuals with debt obligations lack capital to invest in entrepreneurial ventures; research from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reveals that a 3 percent increase in student debt results in a 14.4 percent decrease in small firm formation at the county level.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> Debt obligations delay marriage and family formation, with young adults carrying substantial debt reporting lower likelihood of entering relationships or having children.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup> Consumer spending, retirement savings, and access to future credit all suffer when student loan repayments consume portion of household income.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-36" id="cite-36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>The political economy of student debt involves complex relationships among the federal government, private lending institutions, universities, and students that benefit some actors while imposing costs on others.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup> Student Loan Asset-Backed Securities (SLABS) allow investors to profit from student loan repayments, creating financial incentives for maintaining high debt levels and aggressive collection practices.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-24" id="cite-24">24</a></sup> The federal government ultimately bears much of the default risk, absorbing losses when borrowers cannot repay, yet the rhetoric of individual responsibility frames debt as borrowers' personal problem rather than systemic policy failure.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup> Universities, meanwhile, have substantially raised tuition while simultaneously promoting the availability of student loans, knowing that loan availability enables higher tuition pricing and protects enrollment from what might otherwise be price resistance.<sup class="citation"><a href="#ref-15" id="cite-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-25" id="cite-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-33" id="cite-33">33</a></sup></p>
