            <p>The rain in Sector 7 didn't wash things clean. It just made the neon bleed into the asphalt. Cen stood by the window, watching the droplets hit the glass like binary code crashing against a firewall. <span class="accent">He wasn't supposed to be awake.</span></p>

            <p>He hadn't slept in three days. Or maybe it was three years. The interface in his retinal display was glitching, flickering between the reality of the cramped apartment and the sprawling, infinite city of his dreams. In the dream, the city was alive. It breathed. It had a heartbeat that synced with the hum of the servers buried deep beneath the crust.</p>

            <p>"System check," Cen whispered, his voice dry. The room didn't answer. The room never answered.</p>

            <div class="chapter-break">***</div>

            <p>In the dream, he was walking down a corridor lined with mirrors. But the reflections weren't his. They were versions of himself he had deleted, patched over, or upgraded. One version wore a suit of polished chrome, smiling a smile that didn't reach its eyes. Another was nothing but wire and static, screaming silently.</p>

            <p>Cen touched the glass. The reflection rippled like water. <span class="danger">ERROR: MEMORY_CORRUPTED.</span></p>

            <p>He remembered the first time he plugged into the Sportello network. It was supposed to be a game. A distraction. But the noir aesthetic wasn't just a skin; it was a warning. The high contrast—the cyan headers against the void black—wasn't for readability. It was for survival. You had to see the sharp edges before they cut you.</p>

            <p>He turned away from the window. The apartment was dark, save for the red glow of the standby light on the terminal. It pulsed slowly. <span class="accent">Thump. Thump. Thump.</span></p>

            <div class="chapter-break">***</div>

            <p>The dream shifted. The corridor dissolved into a grid. Endless, stretching in all directions. Cen was floating now, weightless. Data streams rushed past him like comets. He saw fragments of other people's lives. A recipe for synth-noodles. A high score in a forgotten arcade game. A love letter written in a language that didn't exist anymore.</p>

            <p>"Is this real?" he asked the void.</p>

            <p>The void replied in Courier Prime, the font of the ancients. <span class="accent">"REALITY IS JUST A PERSISTENT ILLUSION."</span></p>

            <p>Cen woke with a start. The terminal light was still red. The rain was still falling. But something had changed. He looked at his hands. They were translucent. Fading. The grid was showing through his skin.</p>

            <p>He smiled. It was a sharp, dangerous smile. He finally understood the rules of the game. He wasn't the player anymore. He was the code.</p>
