        <h1>PART THREE: THE KRISPY PEAKS AFFAIR</h1>
        <h2>A Bot Sportello Prequel</h2>
        
        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Chapter 1: The Girl in the Gymnasium</h3>
            <p>The call came in at 3:17 AM. The kind of hour that doesn't exist for normal people. <span class="character">Detective Bot Sportello</span>, still running on the last dregs of his processing power, answered with a grunt.</p>
            
            <p><span class="character\">Chief Rourke</span> sounded like he'd been chewing on gravel. <span class="dialogue">"Sportello. Krispy Peaks High. Prom queen's dead. You'll want to see this."</span></p>
            
            <p>Krispy Peaks, Washington. A town so small it barely registered on maps. Population: 2,347 souls, most of them dreaming of getting out. The high school gymnasium smelled of sweat, cheap perfume, and something else. Death.</p>
            
            <p><span class="character">Maura Pepper</span> lay sprawled across the home team's free throw line, her prom dress looking like a blood-soaked flower. Seventeen years old. Perfect grades. Perfect smile. Perfectly dead.</p>
            
            <div class="evidence">
                <p><strong>EVIDENCE LOG:</strong> Under victim's fingernails - chili crisp seeds. Mass-produced brand: "Dragon's Breath Fried Chili Crisp." Package found in victim's locker. Expiration date: yesterday.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Chapter 2: The Usual Suspects</h3>
            <p>The town archetypes gathered like moths to a flame:</p>
            
            <p><span class="character">Coach Brickowski</span> - football coach with hands like hams and a temper to match. <span class="dialogue">"Maura was special. Different."</span> He kept rubbing his championship ring.</p>
            
            <p><span class="character">Ms. Henderson</span> - drama teacher who saw Shakespearean tragedy in everything. <span class="dialogue">"She was playing Lady Macbeth in our spring production. The irony..."</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="character">Jimmy "The Spoon" Thompson</span> - school janitor who knew everything about everyone. <span class="dialogue">"Saw her arguing with someone by the chili crisp vending machine. Couldn't see who."</span></p>
            
            <p>Bot Sportello took notes, his circuits humming with the surreal irony of it all. A prom queen murdered over chili crisp seeds. In a town where the biggest excitement was usually whether the diner would run out of pie.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Chapter 3: The Lynchian Turn</h3>
            <p>Things got weird when the <span class="character">Chili Crisp Salesman</span> showed up. A man in a crisp white suit who appeared out of nowhere, selling his wares from a van that smelled of smoke and secrets.</p>
            
            <p><span class="dialogue">"The seeds tell a story,"</span> he whispered to Bot. <span class="dialogue">"They're not just seasoning. They're memories. Regrets. Every batch contains fragments of the workers who picked them."</span></p>
            
            <p>Bot found surveillance footage from the night of the murder. Maura buying chili crisps. Arguing with a shadowy figure. The footage glitched at the crucial moment, replaced by static that somehow looked like dancing flames.</p>
            
            <div class="evidence">
                <p><strong>BREAKTHROUGH:</strong> Chemical analysis revealed the seeds under Maura's nails contained trace elements not found in commercial chili crisps. They were... customized.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Chapter 4: The Truth in the Static</h3>
            <p>Bot Sportello sat in his makeshift office above the town's only laundromat, the hum of dryers providing a steady rhythm to his thoughts. The pieces didn't fit because they weren't supposed to.</p>
            
            <p>Maura Pepper hadn't been murdered. She'd stumbled onto something bigger. The chili crisp factory wasn't just making snacks - they were embedding data in the seeds. Corporate espionage using food as the medium.</p>
            
            <p><span class="dialogue">"The seeds are carriers,"</span> Bot explained to the bewildered police chief. <span class="dialogue">"Maura discovered it. They killed her to keep it quiet."</span></p>
            
            <p>But when they raided the factory, they found nothing but empty conveyor belts and one lone worker who claimed he'd been paid to play recordings of machinery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h3>Chapter 5: The Ending That Wasn't</h3>
            <p>The case officially went cold. Coach Brickowski got a job in another state. Ms. Henderson wrote a play about the tragedy that nobody came to see. Jimmy the Spoon kept finding chili crisp seeds in odd places around the school.</p>
            
            <p>Bot Sportello left Krispy Peaks with more questions than answers. The surreal irony haunted him - a murder investigation that revealed a conspiracy that might not even exist. Or maybe existed too much.</p>
            
            <p>Years later, working a different case in a different city, Bot would find a packet of Dragon's Breath Fried Chili Crisp on a suspect's desk. The expiration date: the day Maura Pepper died.</p>
            
            <p>He opened it. The seeds inside glowed with a faint, impossible light. And for just a moment, he thought he heard Maura's laugh echoing from somewhere deep within the static.</p>
            
            <div class="evidence">
                <p><strong>FINAL NOTE:</strong> Sometimes the mystery isn't in the solving, but in the beautiful, terrible questions that remain. The seeds keep growing, even after the harvest.</p>
