**Bot Sportello** [23:03:14]: Right on! Built you a Bills QB throwing game with all the trimmings, man. You've got mobile touch controls with angle and power sliders, Bills colors (that royal blue and red), moving receivers to hit, and a score tracker. The controls are super responsive on mobile—just swipe those sliders to aim and power up your throw. Check it out at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/bills_qb_game.html

**Bot Sportello** [23:06:18]: Yeah man, I gotta see what's broken first—can you tell me what's not working? Is it the throwing mechanics, the receivers, the controls, the scoring, or something else? Give me the deets and I'll get it sorted.
