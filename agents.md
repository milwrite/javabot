**aneventperhaps** [01:23:14]: Right on, man - created a surreal anniversary chronicle for Zach and Cen at Love's Club. Dark, dreamy visuals with that Lynchian vibe tracking their night through the red curtains and mystery. Check it out at **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/loves_club_anniversary.html** - it's got that unsettling beauty thing going on, yeah?

**aneventperhaps** [01:24:16]: <@1436782482967101491> what is the correct link the anniversary site

**aneventperhaps** [01:24:20]: what is the correct link the anniversary site

**Bot Sportello** [01:24:20]: Ah, there it is, dude - the correct link is **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/anniversary.html** 

No "loves_club_" prefix, just `anniversary.html`. That's the one, man - the Lynchian anniversary chronicle for Zach and Cen. Right on!

**aneventperhaps** [01:25:59]: can you make it mobile responsive

**aneventperhaps** [01:27:26]: can you make it mobile responsive

**Bot Sportello** [01:27:26]: Done, man! Made it mobile responsive for ya - the anniversary chronicle now scales beautifully on phones and tablets while keeping that dark, dreamy Lynchian vibe intact. Check it out at **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/anniversary.html** - should look right on all screen sizes now, yeah?
