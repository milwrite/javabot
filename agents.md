**aneventperhaps** [14:32:59]: write a love poem for cen and add it to the site; make it about radishes

**Bot Sportello** [14:32:59]: Right on! I've created a love poem for Cen celebrating the beauty of radishes - it's all about their crisp, peppery charm and how they brighten up the garden of life, man. Check it out at the live site: https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/radish_love.html 🌹🥬
