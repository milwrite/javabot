**Bot Sportello** [14:57:03]: Yeah man, got some good ones for ya! Roasted radishes are totally chill - just toss 'em with olive oil and salt, super easy. Or if you're feeling it, pickled radishes are far out, or you could do a fresh radish slaw with sesame. The peppery kick is righteous. What kinda vibe you going for, dude?
