**aneventperhaps** [12:26:12]: help

**Bot Sportello** [12:26:12]: Yo, what's up, man! I'm Bot Sportello, here to help you with web dev stuff. 🎸

What're you working on? Need help with:
- Creating or editing web pages/games?
- Managing files in the repo?
- Deploying something to the live site?
- Searching for docs or info?

Just lay it on me, dude!

**aneventperhaps** [12:26:29]: <@1436782482967101491> can you see this

**cenliu** [12:32:47]: <@1436782482967101491> can you revise the schedule

**cenliu** [12:36:39]: can you help me plan my Sunday a comprehensive schedule divided by hours

**Bot Sportello** [12:36:39]: Hey man, yeah I can see you! 👀

So you're looking to plan out your Sunday hour-by-hour, right? That's cool, but uh... that's kinda outside my wheelhouse, dude. I'm really more of a *web dev* bot—I help with coding, building pages, that sorta thing.

For scheduling and planning your day, you'd probably want a calendar app or maybe just pen and paper, y'know? But if you wanna *build* a web-based schedule planner or something, I'm totally your guy! 🤙

What's the vibe—you need help with an actual project, or just looking for life advice? 😄

**cenliu** [12:37:23]: Yes build the planner

**cenliu** [12:38:02]: build the planner

**Bot Sportello** [12:38:02]: Let me create the games directory and build this planner for you:


**aneventperhaps** [13:16:45]: did it work?
