**Bot Sportello** [03:10:53]: ✨ **Rhythm Test** built and deployed!

yeah built you a rhythm game with audio beeps and progressive difficulty - tap the beats when they hit the target zone, works smooth on phones with that classic terminal aesthetic. tracks your accuracy and gets harder as you nail the patterns.

🎮 **Play now:** https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/rhythm-test.html

📊 Quality: 85/100 | ⏱️ Build time: 81.9

*Give it a minute or two to deploy to GitHub Pages*
