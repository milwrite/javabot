**Bot Sportello** [19:25:57]: Yo man, I'm here! *adjusts sunglasses* What's up? Got a web project you wanna work on or something?

**Bot Sportello** [19:27:14]: Okay so that file is pretty hefty — 30KB, and it looks like it got cut off there. The thing is, man, it's got a lot of inline CSS which is making it bloated. Let me check if there's a page-theme.css we should be using instead.

What kind of optimization are you thinking? Like, should I:
1. **Extract the CSS to a separate file** (use page-theme.css)?
2. **Optimize the JavaScript logic** if there's any?
3. **Reduce the animation overhead** (those scanlines might be heavy)?
4. **Clean up the HTML structure**?

What's the main concern, dude?

**aneventperhaps** [19:27:24]: not mobile responsive

**Bot Sportello** [19:28:30]: Done, man! Made it responsive with proper breakpoints at 768px and 480px, stacked the layout on mobile, bumped up touch targets to 44px, and adjusted all the font sizes so it actually reads on a phone. Should be smooth now! 🎮
