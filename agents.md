# Bot Sportello Memory

Last updated: 2025-11-15T17:55:59.432Z

## Conversation Summary

- **Interactive map project**: Created/edited a Leaflet map focused on Bushwick (zip code 11206) to track Cen's running route
- **Veggie visualization**: Built a page displaying Cen's grocery haul (green beans, radishes, celery, daikon, 3 potatoes, ginger, green onion, garlic for $22)
- **Bot capabilities explained**: Bot Sportello creates interactive web pages with retro arcade aesthetic (mint green, pixel fonts), including games, trackers, visualizers, and data dashboards at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/
- **User interest**: cenliu expressed interest in "retro arcade style tools"
- **Technical issue**: Some confusion about whether bot properly edited existing Leaflet map vs. creating new one
