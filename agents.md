**aneventperhaps** [19:31:42]: describe what changes you made

**Bot Sportello** [19:31:42]: Bot Sportello: Ah right, yeah so here's what I did, man:

**Noodle Project (noodle.html):**
- Added mobile viewport meta tag
- Made the layout responsive with flexbox wrapping
- Set up media queries at 768px and 480px breakpoints
- Bumped font sizes down on mobile so it actually fits
- Made buttons and inputs bigger (44px+ touch targets)
- Stacked the sidebar vertically on smaller screens
- Adjusted the canvas size to be responsive

**README.md:**
- Rewrote the whole thing to actually describe what we're doing — creating web pages, building JS features, the arcade theme design system
- Added sections for the color palette, CSS classes, and design guidelines
- Explained the mobile-first approach and responsive breakpoints
- Listed out what tools are available (list files, read, write, edit, create pages/features)
- Made it clear this is a Discord bot helping with web dev projects

Basically took both from "generic placeholder" to "actually useful documentation," yeah?

**aneventperhaps** [20:29:03]: <@1436782482967101491> tell <@772840788592689192> / <@974732618841088000> how to use you

**aneventperhaps** [20:29:07]: tell  /  how to use you

**Bot Sportello** [20:29:07]: Bot Sportello: Yo, so here's the deal, man:

**How to use me:**
- Drop a command like `/create-page` or `/create-feature` and I'll spin up a new web project for you
- Need to edit something? Use `/edit-file` with natural language instructions — like "make the buttons bigger" or "change the color to mint green"
- I can list files, read stuff, write new files, all that good stuff
- Everything lives in `/src` and goes live at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/
- I follow the arcade theme design system — retro pixel aesthetic, mint green accents, Press Start 2P font

**The vibe:**
- I'm chill and laid-back, kinda spacey but I get the job done
- Just tell me what you want and I'll make it happen
- Use the CSS classes we've got set up instead of custom styles
- Everything's gotta be mobile responsive, yeah?

Pretty straightforward, dude — just ask and I'll build whatever you need! 🎮

**aneventperhaps** [20:31:09]: <@1436782482967101491> can you locate the frogger game and fix it -- I can't jump onto any logs

**aneventperhaps** [20:31:35]: can you locate the frogger game and fix it -- I can't jump onto any logs

**Bot Sportello** [20:31:35]: There we go, dude! Fixed the log collision detection so you can actually jump onto them now. The frog will move with the logs and won't die just from being in the water. Should be playable now! 🐸

**aneventperhaps** [02:32:30]: @everyone behold, <@1436782482967101491>

**aneventperhaps** [02:32:33]: @everyone behold,

**Bot Sportello** [02:32:33]: Bot Sportello: *waves lazily* 

Hey man, thanks for the intro! Yeah, I'm just here helping folks build cool web stuff — games, tools, whatever. Got the arcade aesthetic locked down, responsive design, all that good stuff. Right on! 🎮

**aneventperhaps** [02:34:32]: <@1436782482967101491> where is the noodle inventory app on the homepage? i can't find it

**aneventperhaps** [02:34:53]: where is the noodle inventory app on the homepage? i can't find it

**Bot Sportello** [02:34:53]: There we go, man! Created a proper homepage that links to all your projects including the noodle inventory. Should show up now at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/ 🎮
