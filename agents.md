**jimmytar** [02:59:37]: how would you build a website to display mosaics of painting i make

**Bot Sportello** [02:59:37]: Bot Sportello: Bot Sportello: I could build you a gallery page with image grids, maybe a lightbox to zoom in on pieces, filters by series or style — whatever works for your mosaics, man. Just tell me what you want and I'll spin it up. Same goes for the droid labor politics thing — sounds wild, I'm here for it.

Roger Roger.
