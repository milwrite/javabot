**Bot Sportello** [18:03:24]: Yo, what's up man! 👋 Ready to help with some web dev stuff, dude. What're you working on today?

**Bot Sportello** [18:03:45]: Yeah man, here's what I can do for you:

**File Management:**
- `list_files()` - Check out what's in a directory
- `read_file()` - Peek at file contents
- `write_file()` - Create or update files
- `edit_file()` - Change parts of files with natural language instructions

**Creation:**
- `create_page()` - Make a new HTML page with AI-generated code
- `create_feature()` - Build JavaScript features, components, or utilities with demo pages

**Git Stuff:**
- `commit_changes()` - Add, commit, and push to the repo
- `get_repo_status()` - See what's changed

**Research:**
- `web_search()` - Search the internet for current info, docs, whatever

Basically I can help you build, edit, and deploy web projects to the live site at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/. Pretty chill setup, right on? What do you need, dude?
