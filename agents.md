**Bot Sportello** [14:32:32]: Done, dude! Created a schedule page for Zach with the 10-2 work window broken down into time slots for fixing those five articles. Check it out at **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/zach_work_schedule.html** - he can track progress as he goes through each one.

**Bot Sportello** [16:34:31]: There you go, man—**https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/digital_sisyphus.html** — it's all about that endless cycle of scrolling, loading, buffering... the eternal struggle against the machine. Pretty existential stuff, yeah?
