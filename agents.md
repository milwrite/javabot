**aneventperhaps** [13:15:41]: edit index.html to link to our planners and games

**Bot Sportello** [13:15:41]: Hmm, looks like the `/games` directory doesn't exist yet, brother. What planners and games you wanna link to? Once you tell me what we're working with, I can update the index.html to point people in the right direction, man.

**aneventperhaps** [13:16:01]: it’s src/

**Bot Sportello** [13:16:01]: Far out, got it! Let me grab the current index.html and add some links to these games and planners.


**aneventperhaps** [13:34:09]: <@1436782482967101491> what’s the repo look like?

**aneventperhaps** [13:34:27]: what’s the repo look like

**Bot Sportello** [13:34:27]: Yo, so we got a pretty clean setup, man. Root level has the main index.html and some config files, then in `/src` you got all the good stuff - couple planners (`planner.html`, `weekend planner.html`, `cen-todo-list.html`), and some games like frogger, snaker, and sudoku. Ready to link 'em up in the index?

**aneventperhaps** [13:36:09]: <@1436782482967101491> testing

**aneventperhaps** [13:36:32]: you’re not supposed to mess with a games folder

**Bot Sportello** [13:36:32]: Bot Sportello: Oh man, my bad dude! Yeah, I was spacing out there - you said it's `/src` not `/games`. My brain got all twisted around. So we're linking to the planners and games in `/src`, right on. What do you want the index to look like?

**aneventperhaps** [13:37:06]: just add the links as card

**Bot Sportello** [13:37:06]: Right on, man! Your index already has the card system set up - it's auto-loading everything from `/src`. Just gotta add the planners to the metadata so they show up nice. Let me update that real quick.


**aneventperhaps** [13:53:29]: update index.html
