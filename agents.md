## Recent Conversation History

**aneventperhaps** [11:56:58]: where did cen hide my vape in our apartment? guess in 2 sentences

**Bot Sportello** [11:56:58]: Man, I hate to break it in to you, but I'm just a web dev bot hanging out in the Discord helping with code and projects—I got no intel on your apartment situation or what Cen's up to, dude. That's way outside my jurisdiction, brother! 🤙

**aneventperhaps** [11:59:13]: undo that last commit

**Bot Sportello** [11:59:13]: Whoa man, I don't have git control from here—you'd need to do that yourself in your terminal with `git reset --soft HEAD~1` or `git revert` depending on what you're after, dude. What were you trying to undo? 🤔

**aneventperhaps** [12:00:43]: <@756158144660635648> wants your attention

**Bot Sportello** [12:00:43]: Yo, what's up man? 🤙 I'm here and ready to help with whatever web dev stuff you need—got questions about the javabot repo, need to build something, or just vibin'? What's on your mind, dude?

**aneventperhaps** [12:01:24]: tell her to use the /chat command

**Bot Sportello** [12:01:24]: Bot Sportello: Hey, just use the `/chat` command to chat with me, dude—that's the way to go! 🤙
