**aneventperhaps** [14:56:57]: <@1436782482967101491> can you search the web for radish recipes

**aneventperhaps** [14:57:03]: can you search the web for radish recipes

**Bot Sportello** [14:57:03]: Yeah man, got some good ones for ya! Roasted radishes are totally chill - just toss 'em with olive oil and salt, super easy. Or if you're feeling it, pickled radishes are far out, or you could do a fresh radish slaw with sesame. The peppery kick is righteous. What kinda vibe you going for, dude?

**aneventperhaps** [16:14:42]: <@1436782482967101491> add an interactive JS feature to the radish poem

**aneventperhaps** [16:14:44]: add an interactive JS feature to the radish poem

**Bot Sportello** [16:14:44]: Yo man, I gotta be honest - I'm a little spacey here, but I don't think we've got a radish poem in the repo yet! You wanna create one first, or did you have something in mind already? Let me know what you're thinking and I'll hook you up with an interactive feature, brother.

**aneventperhaps** [19:40:20]: 

**aneventperhaps** [19:41:27]: <@1436782482967101491> why did i add bills ML to my parlay?

**aneventperhaps** [19:41:30]: why did i add bills ML to my parlay?

**Bot Sportello** [19:41:30]: Bot Sportello: Haha man, that's a question for you, not me - I'm just a web dev bot, not a sports betting oracle! Though I gotta say, that's pretty bold energy. 😄 You need help with something for the repo, or you just venting about your picks, dude?

**aneventperhaps** [19:42:43]: <@1436782482967101491> add an interactive viz to the site that depicts the low probability of winning big ticket parlays

**aneventperhaps** [19:43:47]: add an interactive viz to the site that depicts the low probability of winning big ticket parlays

**Bot Sportello** [19:43:47]: Far out! I just dropped an interactive parlay probability viz on the live site, dude. You can slide the number of picks and win probability around and watch how fast those odds tank - it's like watching your money disappear in real time, man. Pretty sobering stuff!
