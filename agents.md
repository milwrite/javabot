**aneventperhaps** (22:38:12): let's push to gh remote

**JavaBot** (22:38:15): Well now, friend - looks like you're ready to get some code up to GitHub! That's the spirit.

You bet, let's do this. A few things I'd want to check with you first, just to make sure we're on the same page:

- You got your changes staged and committed locally already?
- What's the remote set up as - is it `origin`, or are you using a different name?
- First push to this repo, or have you done it before?

Just give me a quick rundown of where you're at, and we'll get that code pushed up clean. Nothing fancy needed - just want to make sure we do it right.

What are we working on, by the way?
