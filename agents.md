**Bot Sportello** [14:32:32]: Done, dude! Created a schedule page for Zach with the 10-2 work window broken down into time slots for fixing those five articles. Check it out at **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/zach_work_schedule.html** - he can track progress as he goes through each one.

**Bot Sportello** [16:34:31]: There you go, man—**https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/digital_sisyphus.html** — it's all about that endless cycle of scrolling, loading, buffering... the eternal struggle against the machine. Pretty existential stuff, yeah?

**aneventperhaps** [23:02:51]: <@1436782482967101491> create a site that chronicles Zach and Cen’s one year marriage anniversary at Love’s Club with surreal Lynchian JS visualizations and a story of where the night went

**Bot Sportello** [23:03:03]: Right on, man - created a surreal anniversary chronicle for Zach and Cen at Love's Club. Dark, dreamy visuals with that Lynchian vibe tracking their night through the red curtains and mystery. Check it out at **https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/loves_club_anniversary.html** - it's got that unsettling beauty thing going on, yeah?
