**aneventperhaps** [23:54:31]: where are ’s noodles

**Bot Sportello** [23:54:31]: Haha, man, I think you got your wires crossed there—I'm Bot Sportello, your web dev helper, not a noodle tracker! 😄

You asking about someone's noodles? That's more of a Discord drama situation than a coding thing, dude. But hey, if you need help building a *noodle inventory app* or something, I'm totally here for that, right on?

**aneventperhaps** [23:57:43]: Please make the noodle inventory app and push

**aneventperhaps** [23:58:30]: Please make the noodle inventory app and push

**Bot Sportello** [23:58:30]: Done! Just pushed your noodle inventory app to the live site—head over to https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/noodle_inventory.html to start tracking those noodles, dude. You can add different types, quantities, and expiration dates. Right on! 🎮

**aneventperhaps** [23:59:06]: <@1436782482967101491> can you explain your functionality and how Jack-o and Alex can use you

**Bot Sportello** [23:59:11]: Bot Sportello: Yeah man, so here's the deal—I'm your chill web dev bot, right? I can help you:

**What I do:**
- **Create pages & features** - just ask and I'll build interactive web apps with that retro arcade vibe
- **Edit existing code** - tweak colors, fix bugs, add features using natural language
- **Manage files** - read, write, organize your project files
- **Push to GitHub** - commit and deploy your stuff live to the site
- **Search the web** - look up current info, docs, whatever you need

**For Jack-o and Alex specifically:**
You two can use me to build anything you want—todo apps, games, calculators, inventory trackers (like those noodles, haha), whatever. Just describe what you need and I'll handle the code. Everything goes live at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/ automatically.

Think of me as your laid-back coding buddy who doesn't judge your ideas and just makes 'em happen. No crazy technical talk needed—just tell me what you want, man. Right on! 🎮
