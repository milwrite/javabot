## Conversation Summary

- **Project**: “The River Riddle” – scroll-reveal page (riddle-river.html) that progressively shows the riddle, accepts user input at bottom, and plays synthesized audio on scroll / success / error.  
- **User requests**: initial build → full musical/audio overhaul → “fix the audio and music” → update & link devlog.md.  
- **Technical notes**: mobile-first, Web-Audio-API-only (no files), separate toggles for ambient vs SFX, tied to existing page-styles.css.  
- **Context window**: last 3 prompts were “fix the audio…”, “update the devlog.md”, and “link it” (×3), followed by “what’s in your context window right now?”

**aneventperhaps** [05:12:36]: what’s in your context window right now?

**Bot Sportello** [05:12:36]: Right on, lemme check what I'm holding...

**In my head right now:**

- **Your riddle-river project** - scroll-reveal with Web Audio API synthesis, ambient pads, success chords, error buzzes, toggle controls

- **Site structure** - javabot repo at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/, noir terminal theme, mobile-first design system with page-theme.css

- **Recent work** - you just built the riddle site, fixed audio/music twice, pushed it live

- **My personality** - chill Doc Sportello vibes, short responses, tool access to git/files/web search

- **Project metadata** - collections system, SITE_INVENTORY.md tracks everything, projectmetadata.json keeps index aligned

- **Design rules** - 44px touch targets, CRT scanlines, #7ec8e3 sky blue accent, mobile controls required for games, responsive breakpoints at 768px/480px/360px

- **Your agents.md** - conversation history stored there for context

But honestly man, I'm a bit spacey on *specific* details about what else is on your site. Want me to check SITE_INVENTORY.md or git log to see the full picture? Could pull up recent commits or list what pages you've got deployed.

**aneventperhaps** [05:13:35]: <@1436782482967101491> what’s in your context window right now?

**aneventperhaps** [05:13:46]: what’s in your context window right now?

**Bot Sportello** [05:13:46]: Yeah man, I'm holding:

- Your riddle-river project with Web Audio API synthesis

- The noir terminal design system (page-theme.css, mobile-first, CRT effects)

- Recent commits showing scroll-reveal + audio fixes

- My Doc Sportello personality (chill, short responses)

- Tool access to git/files/search/web

- Project metadata system (collections, SITE_INVENTORY.md)

- Mobile design rules (44px touch targets, responsive breakpoints)

Basically the whole conversation flow since you started building the riddle site, plus my general repo knowledge. What's up?

Ah man, sorry - looks like the search didn't pull up anything specific for CUNY Graduate Center library roles right now. Could be they filled the position or it got pulled down.

Want me to try searching broader for CUNY system library jobs across their campuses? Or check if there's anything at other university libraries in the city? NYU, Columbia, or the NYPL system might have similar academic library gigs.
