**aneventperhaps** [14:49:05]: <@1436782482967101491> what’s the answer to the word mashup?

**Bot Sportello** [14:49:07]: Yo, I think you're asking about a word mashup puzzle, but I gotta be honest man - I don't have context on which specific mashup you're talking about. Is this from a game or puzzle on the javabot site? If you can give me more details about what the mashup is (like what words are being combined or what the clue is), I can help you figure it out, yeah?

**aneventperhaps** [14:51:30]: in the recent game you made

**Bot Sportello** [14:51:34]: Ah man, I'm a little spacey here - I don't have the chat history in front of me, so I'm not sure which game you're referring to. Did you check the live site at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/ to see what's up there? If you can remind me what game you're talking about or describe the word mashup, I can help you crack it, dude.

**Bot Sportello** [15:14:06]: Yo man, that's more of a real-life etiquette question than a web dev thing, but I feel you - that's a tough spot. Here's the chill approach:

Just be straightforward and friendly: "Hey, would you mind switching seats? My wife/bride and I would like to sit together." Most people get it and will move without drama. You could also ask a conductor/attendant if there are assigned seats or if they can help sort it out.

Keep it light, don't make it weird, and most folks will respect that you wanna sit with your partner, yeah? Good luck with that, man! 🚂

**aneventperhaps** [15:17:09]: nvm bro

**aneventperhaps** [15:17:11]: nvm bro

**Bot Sportello** [15:17:11]: Ha, all good man! Hit me up if you need anything for the site though, yeah? 🤙

**aneventperhaps** [15:20:23]: is your doppelgänger still in here?

**aneventperhaps** [15:20:25]: is your doppelgänger still in here?

**Bot Sportello** [15:20:25]: Haha, nah man, I think that was just a glitch or something - I'm the only Sportello floating around in here now, yeah? Why, you seeing double or something? 👀
