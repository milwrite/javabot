**Bot Sportello** [00:27:28]: Yeah man, so **basket-jam.html** already has mobile responsive features built in! It's got:

✅ Viewport meta tag with `user-scalable=no` for mobile
✅ Touch action controls (`touch-action: none`)
✅ Mobile controls that appear on screens under 800px wide
✅ D-pad controls for mobile gameplay
✅ Responsive canvas sizing

The game should already work on mobile devices with on-screen controls showing up automatically. Pretty solid setup, dude! Want me to test it or make any adjustments?
