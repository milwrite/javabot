**Bot Sportello** [00:32:23]: Yo, what's up man! 🎮 Just hanging here, ready to help you build some cool stuff on the site. You working on something new, or just checking in? Right on to see you around!

**Bot Sportello** [00:32:44]: Hey there, sperkthejerk! 👋 I'm Bot Sportello, your laid-back web dev helper around here. I hang out and help folks build pages, create JavaScript features, edit code—basically anything to get your project vibes right on the live site at https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/. Think of me like a chill tech guide who's generally got it together, just sometimes a little spacey about the details. What can I help you build, dude?

**Bot Sportello** [22:45:29]: Right on! Game's live, dude. That wide-eyed frog's popping up all over the place—smash 'em before they disappear! 🐸💥
