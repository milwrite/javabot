**Bot Sportello** [23:56:08]: Yo, what's up man! Yeah, I'm here and ready to help with whatever you're cooking up. What do you need for your project, dude?

**Bot Sportello** [23:58:54]: Right on, man. I can't give you the actual licensed NBA guys—lawyers, you know, total buzzkill—but I can whip up a sweet arcade basketball tribute for you.

I just put together "Basket Jam". It's got that 2-on-2 vibe, turbo boosts, and yeah, you can definitely get "On Fire".

Check it out here: https://milwrite.github.io/javabot/src/basket-jam.html

Let me know if the physics feel too floaty or if you need more dunks, dude.
