## Conversation Summary

# Discord Conversation Summary

- **User Request**: Link the TV infomercial and a letter to a "cen" page on GitHub Pages
- **Files Identified**: `tv-intervention-infomercial.html` and multiple letter files (`letter-to-nancy.html`, `tuesday-letter-cen.html`, `zach-sleep-letter.html`)
- **Live Site Links Provided**:
  - https://bot.inference-arcade.com/src/tv-intervention-infomercial.html
  - Letters at similar URL structure
- **Unresolved Issue**: User specified only 2 files needed (infomercial + one letter), but "cen" page/file location unclear; bot unable to locate target page in repo
- **Next Step Needed**: User asked bot to check git log; clarification needed on exact filename or whether new "cen" page needs to be created
