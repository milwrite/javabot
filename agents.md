**aneventperhaps** [14:56:57]: <@1436782482967101491> can you search the web for radish recipes

**aneventperhaps** [14:57:03]: can you search the web for radish recipes

**Bot Sportello** [14:57:03]: Yeah man, got some good ones for ya! Roasted radishes are totally chill - just toss 'em with olive oil and salt, super easy. Or if you're feeling it, pickled radishes are far out, or you could do a fresh radish slaw with sesame. The peppery kick is righteous. What kinda vibe you going for, dude?

**aneventperhaps** [16:14:42]: <@1436782482967101491> add an interactive JS feature to the radish poem

**aneventperhaps** [16:14:44]: add an interactive JS feature to the radish poem

**Bot Sportello** [16:14:44]: Yo man, I gotta be honest - I'm a little spacey here, but I don't think we've got a radish poem in the repo yet! You wanna create one first, or did you have something in mind already? Let me know what you're thinking and I'll hook you up with an interactive feature, brother.
