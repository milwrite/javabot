# Dissertation Research Ideas - Bridge Roles & Cross-Platform Analysis

## Current Focus: Reddit Environmental Scan
Based on: https://bot.inference-arcade.com/src/search/conduct-environmental-scan-reddit-focusing-2026-01.html

## TODO List

### [ ] Bridge Role Typology
- **Output**: Typology of bridge roles (prosocial vs antisocial brokerage)
- **Research**: Identify patterns of user behavior in bridging positions
- **Methods**: Network analysis, user behavior tracking

### [ ] Cross-Platform Bridging Scan
- **Focus**: Bridge users connecting Reddit ↔ Discord, X, YouTube, Telegram, Substack, GitHub
- **Patterns**: Link-sharing behaviors, migration events between platforms
- **Data**: Cross-platform user activity, content migration patterns

### [ ] Language/Identity/Subculture Translation Scan
- **Analysis**: How bridge users translate jargon, norms, and "epistemic styles" across communities
- **Examples**: Expertise subs → mainstream subs translation patterns
- **Output**: Qualitative coding scheme + examples of translation moves

### [ ] Intervention Scan: Platform Design for Bridging
- **Existing interventions**: Quarantine, crowd control, automod filters, cross-sub linking policies, comment throttling
- **Research**: What interventions affect bridging without killing discovery
- **Output**: Recommendations for platform design that supports positive bridging

## Next Steps
- Conduct targeted web searches in #research channel focused on Reddit data
- Expand environmental scan to include specific bridge user examples
- Develop coding framework for qualitative analysis
